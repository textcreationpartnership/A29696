            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some of the Ancients were wont to paint Peace in the form of a Woman with a horn of plenty in her hands, <hi>viz.</hi> all bleſſings. The Orator, hit it when he ſaid, <hi>Dulce nomen pacis,</hi> the very name of Peace is ſweet.

Now did not God raiſe up Magiſtrates, and ſpirit Magiſtrates to owne them, to ſtand by them, and to defend them in all honeſt and juſt ways, how ſoon would they be devoured and deſtroyed?

Certainly had ſome hot-headed, and little-witted, and fierce-ſpirited men had but two or three days liberty to have done what they pleaſed in this great City during your Lordſhips Mayoralty, they would have made ſad work in the midſt of us. When a righteous Government fails, then, 1. Order fails, 2. Religion fails, 3. Trade fails, 4. Juſtice fails, 5. Proſperity fails, 6. Strength and Power fails, 7. Fame and Honour fails, 8.

It is well known that the conſtitution of a mans body is beſt known by his pulſe; if it ſtir not at all, then we know he is dead; if it ſtir violently, then we know him to be in a Fever; if it keep an equal ſtroke, then we know he is ſound, well, and whole: So the eſtate and conſtitution of a City, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Common-weal is beſt known by the manner of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juſtice therein; for juſtice is the pulſe of a City, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Common-weal; if juſtice be violent, then the City, Kingdom, or Common-weal is in a Fever, in a very bad eſtate; if it ſtir not at all, then the City, Kingdom, or Common-wealth is dead: but if it hath an equal ſtroke, if it be juſtly and duely adminiſtred, then the City, Kingdom, or Common-weal is in a good, a ſafe, and a ſound condition.

Extream right often proves extream wrong: he that will always go to the utmoſt of what the Law allows, will too too often do more than the Law requires. A rigid ſeverity often mars all: Equity is ſtill to be perferred before extremity. To inflict great penalties and heavy cenſures for light offences, this is to kill a flye upon a mans forehead with a Beetle.

Both the Statues of the <hi>Theban</hi> Judges and the Statues of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Judges were made without hands and without eyes, to intimate to us, that as Judges ſhould have no hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Bribes, ſo they ſhould have no eyes to ſee a friend from a foe, or a brother from a ſtranger in judgment.

            <p>The 25. verſe is the Scripture that I do intend to ſpeak ſomething to, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt. Now the Propoſition which I only intend to inſiſt upon, is this. <hi>Viz.</hi>

            <p>Now that God is the Author or Efficient cauſe of all the great Calamities and dreadful Judgments that are inflicted upon Cities and Countries, will evidently appear to every mans underſtanding, that will but take the pains to read over the 26.

            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That great afflictions, dreadful Judgments, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> likened unto fire in the bleſſed Scriptures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 12.

He hath cut off in his anger all the horn of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and burned againſt <hi>Jacob</hi> like a flaming fire which devoureth round about, he hath bent his bow like an enemy, he ſtood with his right hand as an adverſary, and ſlew all that was pleaſant to the eye in the Tabernacle of the Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> he poured out his fury like fire. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 7.

As they gather Silver and Braſs, and Iron and Lead, and Tin into the midſt of the furnace to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; ſo will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you: yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye ſhall be melted in the midſt thereof: As ſilver is melted in the midſt of the furnace, ſo ſhall ye be melted in the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40825:20"/> and ye ſhall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you. Thus you ſee that great afflictions, great Judgments are likened unto fire.</p>
            <p>But in what reſpects are great Afflictions, great Judgments <label type="milestone">

               </label>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Fire is very dreadful and terrible to mens thoughts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſpirits, and apprehenſions; how dreadful was the fire of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the fire of <hi>London</hi> to all that were near it, or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of it! 'Tis obſervable, that ſome are ſet out in the bleſſed Scriptures as Monuments of moſt terrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vengeance, whom the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> roaſted in the fire; <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 21, 22.</note> of them, 'tis ſaid, ſhall be taken up a curſe; when any impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſore vengeance from the Lord upon any one, 'tis ſaid, The Lord make thee like <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> whom the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> roaſted in the fire. 'Tis very dreadful and terrible for a man to have the leaſt member of his body frying in the fire; but how terrible and dreadful muſt it be for a mans whole body to be roaſted in the fire! ſo are the Judgments of the Lord very terrible and dreadful to the children of men. My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 120.</note> am afraid of thy Judgments. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 16. When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice: rottenneſs entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf, that I might reſt in the day of trouble. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Fire is very painful and tormenting (in which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> reſpects Hell-torments are compared to fire) ſo are great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and Judgments, they are very painful and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 17, 18.</note> they put a Land into ſore travel; next to the pangs of Conſcience, and the pangs of Hell, there are none to thoſe pangs that are bred and fed by terrible Judgments. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Fire is of a diſcovering nature, it enlightens mens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> eyes to ſee thoſe things that they did not ſee before; ſo do the terrible Judgments of God enlighten mens minds and <note place="margin">Rev. 15. 4. Ezek. 21. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> underſtandings ſometimes to know the Lord. Hence 'tis, that after Judgments threatned, God doth ſo often tell them,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40825:21"/> that they ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> know the Lord Sometimes God by his Judgments enlightens mens minds to ſee ſuch an evil in ſin, that they never ſaw before, and to ſee ſuch a vanity, mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, imporency, and uncertainty in the Creature, that they never ſaw before; and to ſee ſuch a need of free-grace, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich mercy, and of infinite favour and goodneſs, that they never ſaw before; and to ſee ſuch Majeſty and terribleneſs <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 3. 5.</note> in God, which they never ſaw before. <hi>Job</hi> 37. 22. With God is terrible Majeſty. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Fire is probatory and refining, and ſo are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Judgments of God, they will try what metal men are made of; they will try whether men are ſound and ſincere, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 25. Mal. 3. 1, 2, 3. Acts 26. 28, 29.</note> and hollow; whether men are real Chriſtians, or nominal Chriſtians; whether they are throughout Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or almoſt Chriſtians; whether their graces are true or counterfeit, and whether they have much, or but a litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e grace. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 9. The Lords fire is in <hi>Zion,</hi> and his furnace in <hi>Jeruſalem. Zacha.</hi> 13. 9. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as ſilver is refined, and will try them as gold is tryed. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal, which is to try you. Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt night; Torches are the better for beating; Grapes come not to the proof, till they come to the preſs; Spices ſmell ſweeteſt, when pounded; young Trees root the faſter for ſhaking; Vines are the better for bleeding; Gold looks the brighter for ſcouring; and Juniper ſmells ſweeteſt in the fire: The Application is eaſie. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Fire is of a conſuming and devouring nature (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> we have lately found by woful Experience) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 8. There went out a ſmoak out of his noſtrils, and fire out of his <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 15, 16. Pſal. 21 9. Jer. 17. 4. Ezek. 38. 19, 20.</note> nouth devoured. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 14. A fire is kindled in my anger, which ſhall burn upon you. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 31. Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them, I have conſumed them with the fire of my wrath. Natural fire is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer, but myſtical fire, the fire of divine wrath, is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a greater devourer: men may ſtand before a natural fire,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40825:21"/> but no man has ever bin able to ſtand before the devouring fire of divine wrath. The anger and wrath of God againſt wicked men is exceeding hot, 'tis a burning, fiery, flaming wrath, againſt which they are never able to ſtand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4. Who would ſet the bryars and thorns againſt me in battel, I would go through them, I would burn them together. Bryars and thorns are as well able to ſtand before a devouring fire, as wicked men are able to ſtand before the ſmoaking wrath of that God which is a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 29.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Fire breaks out ſuddenly and unexpectedly, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> an hour, in a moment, when no man thinks of it, when no man looks for it; as you ſee by that late dreadful fire, that in a few days turn'd a glorious City into a ruinous heap: So the Judgments of God, they come ſuddenly and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſons of men, witneſs the Judgments of God that came upon the old world, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Nadab</hi> and <note place="margin">Math. 24. 37, 38, 39. Gen. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Abihu, Corah, Dathon,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 3. For when they ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape. Security is a certain fore-runner of deſolation and deſtruction. The Apoſtle by the ſimilitude he uſes, ſhews that the deſtruction of the wicked is, 1. certain, 2. ſudden, 3. inevitable. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Fire is impartial, it makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> rich and poor, high and low, honourable and baſe, bond and free, male and fema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, &amp;c. So the Judgments of God are impartial, they reach all ſorts and ranks of perſons. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly and laſtly, Fire is violent and irreſiſtable; we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> have had as dreadful a proof of this in the late dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of <hi>London,</hi> as ever any people have had ſince the Lord Jeſus was on earth: So are the Judgments of God vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and irreſiſtable, witneſs the raging Peſtilence and the bloody Sword, that in 1665. and 1666. has ſent many ſcore thouſands to their long homes. And thus you ſee how that Metaphorically or Typically great and ſore Judgments do reſemble fire. But,</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40825:22"/>
            <p> Secondly, Premi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e this with me; fire is ſometimes attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> unto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 29. Our God is a conſuming fire; ſometimes fire is attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. But who ray abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers ſope. And ſometimes fire is attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me, is mightier then I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, that is, with that fiery Holy Ghoſt, that Spirit of Judgment and of burning wherewith the filth of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Zion</hi> is waſhed away, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Premiſe this with me; the word <hi>Fire</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is ſometimes uſed by the Holy Ghoſt to ſet forth ſin by, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 18.

Hence it is, that <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 7.</note> the Angels are called Seraphims, which ſignifies burning or flaming ones, and they are ſet forth by this name, to note <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 2.</note> their irreſiſtable power; for as there is no withſtanding of the furious flames, ſo there is no withſtanding of theſe burning or flaming ones. <hi>Jerom, Muſculus,</hi> and ſeveral others are of opinion, that the Angel that deſtroyed of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Hoſt <note place="margin">2 Kings 19. 35.</note> a hundred and fourſcore and five thouſand in one night, that he did it by fire, burning their bodies, their garments being untoucht. But the fire in the Propoſition cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the bleſſed Angels, for ſeveral reaſons not here to be alledged. But,</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40825:22"/>
            <p> Fifthly, Premiſe this with me; fire in Scripture is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> taken for Wars. The fire of thine enemies (that is, the Wars that ſhall be amongſt the Nations) ſhall devour them. <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 11, 12. Chap. 29. 6, 7.</note> Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord with a flame of devouring fire; but the Nations that fight againſt the Altar, ſhall be a dream. Now fire in this ſenſe is not to be excluded out of the Propoſition. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Premiſe this with me; fire ſometimes notes the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſpecial preſence of God in a way of ſpecial love and favour to his people in; <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2. you read how the Lord appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in a flame of fire out of the midſt of a Buſh; and he looked, and behold, the buſh burned with fire, and the buſh was not conſumed: here was a repreſentation of the Churches affliction that was then in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a houſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 20.</note> in the midſt of a fiery furnace: But now the Lord was in the buſh, while the buſh (the dry buſh, or the Bramble-buſh, as the Hebrew word ſignifies) was in a flaming fire. In <note place="margin">Seneh.</note> that <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 16. you read of the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh, God was there in a way of merciful prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and preſervation; they were in the fire, but the Lord was with them in the fire, in all their fiery tryals God did bear them company. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Premiſe this with me; in the bleſſed Scriptures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> we read of ſupernal fire, of fire that came down from above, and that, 1. as a ſign of Gods anger: ſo fire came down from Heaven on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Gen.</hi> 19. 24. Alſo fire <note place="margin">Numb. 16. 35.</note> came down from Heaven on them that offered incenſe in the conſpiracy of <hi>Korah.</hi> And ſo fire came down from Heaven <note place="margin">2 Kings 1. 10, 11, 12. 2 Chron. 7. 1. 2 Kings 18. 38.</note> on the two Captains and their Fifties. Secondly, we read of fire that came down from Heaven as a ſign and token of Gods favour. And ſo fire came down from Heaven on the Sacrifice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and on the Sacrifice of <hi>Eliah.</hi> God in thoſe times did delight to ſhew his ſpecial love and favour to his precious ſervants by fire from Heaven: But in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we are to underſtand not ſupernal, but material fire. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly and laſtly, Premiſe this with me; fire is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40825:23"/> taken literally for that material fire that conſumes, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <note place="margin">See 2 Chron. 36. 19. 2 Kings 19. 18. Chap. 21. 6. Pſal. 74. 7. Deut. 13. 16.</note> Towns, Cities, and the moſt ſtately Structures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 10. For I have ſet my face againſt this City for evil, and not for good, ſaith the Lord, it ſhall be given into the hand of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and he ſhall burn it with fire, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 13. And they roaſted the Paſſover with fire, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 3. And they ſaid unto me, the remnant that are left of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity there in the Province, are in great affliction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo is broken down, and the Gates thereof are burnt with fire, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 2, 3. Wherefore the King ſaid unto me, why is thy countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſick? this is nothing but ſorrow of heart: then I was very ſore afraid, and ſaid unto the King, Let the King live for ever, why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the City, the place of my fathers ſepulchres lyeth waſte, and the gates thereof are conſumed with fire? Now this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial fire is the fire that is meant in the Propoſition. O Sirs! God is as much the Author or Efficient cauſe of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire, as he is the Author or Efficient cauſe of Sword, Famine, and Peſtilence. This I have in part proved already; but ſhall more abundantly make it good in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat which follows.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Sir, we know very well that God is the Author or Efficient cauſe of this dreadful Judgment of Fire, as well as he is the Author or Efficient cauſe of any other Judgment that we have either felt or feared: But we earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to know what the ends of God ſhould be in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſore and heavy Judgment of Fire upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in turning their glorious City into aſhes. This we are ſure of, that whoever kindled the fire, God did blow the coal, and therefore we ſhall not now conſider what there was of mans treachery concurring with Gods ſeverity in that dreadful Calam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y by Fire; but rather inquire after the grounds, reaſons, or ends that God aims at by that fiery Diſpenſation that has lately paſt upon us.</p>
            <p>Now here give me leave to ſay, that ſo far as the late Fire was a heavy Judgment of God upon the City, yea, upon the whole Nation, the ends of God in-inflicting that Judgment, are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40825:23"/> doubtleſs ſuch as reſpect both ſinners and Saints, the righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous and the wicked, the prophane and the holy, the good and the bad. Now ſuch as reſpect the wicked and ungodly, I take to be theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he may evidence his Soveraignty, and that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> may know that there is a God. The prophane Atheiſt ſaith in his heart, there is no God; but God by his terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1. Pſal. 10. 4, 5. Pſal. 50. 21. Eccle. 8. 11.

When God appears in flames of fire, devouring and deſtroying all before him, then the proudeſt and the ſtouteſt Atheiſts in the world will confeſs, that there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a God; yea, then they will bow and tremble under a ſenſe of the Soveraignty of God. The Soveraignty of God is that golden Scepter in his hand, which he will make all bow to, either by his Word or by his Works, by his Mercies or by his Judgments. This Scepter muſt be kiſt and ſubmitted to, or elſe fire and ſword, deſolation and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will certainly follow. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 2, 3, 4. 6. Ariſe, and go down to the potters houſe, and there will I cauſe thee to hear my word. Then I went down to the potters houſe, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the veſſel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter, ſo he made it again another veſſel that ſeemed good to the potter to make it. O houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> cannot I do with you as the potter? ſaith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potters hand, ſo are ye in my hand, O houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Jews were ſo ſtupid and ſottiſh, that verbal teaching without ſigns would not work upon them, and therefore the Lord ſent <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to the potters houſe, that he might ſee by what the potter did, that though he had made them a People, a Nation, a Church, a State; yet he could as eaſily unmake them and mar them, as the potter marred the veſſel that he had made. God would have this people to know, that he had as much power over them, and all they had, as the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had power over the clay that he works upon; and that he had as much both might and right alſo to diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure, as the potter had over his clay to diſpoſe of it as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40825:24"/> he judged meet. Nay, Beloved, the potter has not ſuch an <note place="margin">God hath <hi>jus ad omnia, jus in omnibus,</hi> a right to all things, a right in all things.</note> abſolute power over his pots and clay, as the Lord has over the Sons of men, to make them, and break them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and that partly, becauſe that the clay is none of his creature; and partly, becauſe without God give him ſtrength he has no power to make or break one veſſel. God by the Prophet would have the Jews to know that 'twas meerly by his good pleaſure and grace, that they came to be ſo glorious and flouriſhing a Nation as they were at this time; yea, and further to know, that they were not ſo great, and rich, and flouriſhing, and ſetled, and built, but that he could as eaſily break them and mar them, as the potter could the <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 8.</note> veſſel that was under his hand. Ah, Sirs, God, by that dreadful fire that has deſtroyed our houſes, and burnt up our ſubſtance, and baniſhed us from our habitations, and levelled our ſtately Monuments of Antiquity and Glory even with the ground, has given us a very high evidence of his Soveraignty both over our perſons and all our concernments in this world. Ah, <hi>London! London!</hi> were there none within nor without thy Walls that did deny the Soveraignty of God, that did belye the Soveraignty of God, that did ſlight the Soveraignty of God, that did make head againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God? Were there none within nor without thy Walls that did ſay, We are Lords, and we will come no more unto thee? That did ſay, Is not this great <hi>Babylon</hi> (is <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 31. Dan. 4. 30. Lam. 4. 12.</note> not this great <hi>London)</hi> that we have built? That did ſay, the Kings of the Earth, and all the Inhabitants of the World would not have believed, that the adverſary and the enemy (the flaming and conſuming fire) ſhould have entred into the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (into the Gates of <hi>London.)</hi> That <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 2.</note> did ſay, Who is the Lord, that we ſhould obey his voice? That did advance a worldly Soveraignty above and againſt the Soveraignty of God and Chriſt? Ah, <hi>London! London!</hi> if there were any ſuch within or without thy Walls, then never wonder, that God has in a flaming and conſuming fire, proclaimed his Soveraignty over thee, and that he hath given ſuch Atheiſts to know from woful experience, that both themſelves and all their concernments are in the hands of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40825:24"/> Lord, as the clay is in the hands of the potter; and that the ſoreſt Judgments that any City can fall under, are but the <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 16.</note> demonſtrations of his Soveraign Prerogative. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 16. The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth; the Power, Juſtice, and Soveraignty of God ſhines moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in the execution of his Judgments upon the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God inflicts great and ſore Judgments upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sons of men, that the world may ſtand in awe of him, and that they may learn to fear and tremble before him: when he <note place="margin">Conſult theſe Scriptures, Exod. 15. 14, 15, 16. Joſh. 2. 10, 11. Rev. 15. 4.</note> appears as a conſuming fire, he expects that the Nation ſhould tremble, and that the Inhabitants ſhould fear before him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 4. And <hi>Samuel</hi> did that which the Lord ſpake, and came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the Elders of the Town trembled at his coming, and ſaid, comeſt thou peaceable? Shall the Elders of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> tremble for fear that <hi>Samuel</hi> came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſome grievous Judgment againſt them? and ſhall not we tremble when God has executed his terrible Judgments <note place="margin">1 Kings 21. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 27, 28, 29.</note> upon us? Shall <hi>Ahab</hi> tremble and humble himſelf, and faſt and lye in ſackcloth, when Judgments are but threatned? and ſhall not we tremble and fear before the great God, who has actually inflicted upon us his three great Judgments, Peſtilence, Sword, and Fire? Shall the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> both Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Jonah 3. 3, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> Nobles, and people tremble and humble themſelves in ſackcloth and aſhes, when God doth but threaten to over-throw their great, their rich, their populous City? and ſhall not we tremble and lye low before the Lord, when we ſee great <hi>London,</hi> rich and populous <hi>London</hi> laid in aſhes before our eyes? When the hand of the Lord was ſtretched out <note place="margin">Exod. 15. 15, 16. See 2 Kings 6. 30. and Chap. 7. 6, 7. 15. Jer. 4. 7, 8, 9.</note> againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Edom</hi> were amazed, and the mighty men of <hi>Moab</hi> trembled. Ah, how ſeverely has the hand of the Lord been ſtretched out againſt <hi>London</hi> and all her Inhabitants! and therefore what cauſe have we to be amazed, and to tremble before that God who has appeared in flames of fire againſt us! <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 3, 4. He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath drawn back his right hand before the enemy, and he burned againſt <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. He bent his bow like an enemy, and poured out his fury like fire.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40825:25"/> God burnt down their City, their Temple, their Gates, their Princely Habitations, their glorious Structures in the fierceneſs of his anger, and in the greatneſs of his wrath O, Sirs, when God falls upon burning work, when he pours out his fury like fire, when like a flaming fire he devours all our pleaſant things, and lays all our glory in duſt and aſhes, we may ſafely conclude, that his anger is fierce, and that his wrath is great againſt us; and therefore what eminent cauſe have we to fear and tremble before him! God is a great and dreadful God. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 4. A mighty God and terrible. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 21. A great and terrible God. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 5. He is ſo in himſelf, and he has been ſo in his fiery Diſpenſations towards us, that the world by ſuch remarkable ſeverities, may be kept in awe of him. Generally fear doth more in the <note place="margin">We are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom)</hi> of Hell, if for no other cauſe, yet for fearing Hell and the evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more then Chriſt. <hi>Chryſ.

               </note> world then love. As there is little ſincerity, ſo there is but little ingenuity in the world; and that is the reaſon why many very rarely think of God, but when they are afraid of him. Many times Judgments work where Mercies do not win. That famous <hi>Thomas Waldo</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> ſeeing among many met together to be merry, one ſuddenly fall down dead in the ſtreet; it ſtruck ſo to his heart, that he went home a penitent: it wrought to a ſevere and pious reformation of his life, and he lived and dyed a precious man. Though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not a pin the better for all the heavy Judgments that God inflicted upon him; yet <hi>Jethro</hi> taking notice of thoſe dreadful Plagues and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that fell upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and upon his people, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> was thereby converted and became a Proſelyte; as <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> noteth upon that 19. of <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. The world is ſo untractable, that frowns will do more with them then ſmiles. That God may keep wicked men in awe and in ſubjection to him, he ſees it very needful to bring common, and general, and over-ſpreading Judgments upon them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 4. Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? for thou only art holy; for all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee; for thy Judgments are made manifeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O, Sirs, when the Judgments of the Lord come to be made manifeſt, then it highly concerns all ranks
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40825:25"/> and ſorts of men to fear the Lord, and to glorifie his Name. How manifeſt, how viſible has the raging Peſtilence and the bloody Sword, and the devouring Flames of <hi>London</hi> been in the midſt of us! and, O that our fear, and dread, and awe of God were as manifeſt and as viſible as his Judgments have been and ſtill are! for his hand to this very hour is ſtretched out againſt us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 12. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God inflicts great and ſore Judgments upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sons of men, and upon Cities and Countries, to expreſs and make known his Power, Juſtice, Anger, Severity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt ſinners and their ſinful courſes, by which <note place="margin">See Jer. 14. 15, 16. Lam. 4. 11. Jer. 4. 15. to verſe 19.</note> he has been provoked. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 19. And when the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking of his ſons and of his daughters. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities, and I will provoke them to anger with a fooliſh Nation. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. For a fire is kindled in my anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the mountains. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. They ſhall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat (or with burning coals) and with bitter deſtruction. There is a knowledge of God by his Works as well as by his Word, and by his Judgments as well as by his mercies. In his dreadful Judgments every one may run and read his Power, his Juſtice, his Anger, his Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and his Indignation againſt ſin and ſinners: 'Tis irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſins that bring irrevocable Judgments upon ſinners; whilſt men hold on in committing great iniquities, God will hold on in inflicting anſwerable ſeverities. When God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail with men to deſiſt from ſinning, men ſhall not prevail with God to deſiſt from deſtroying of them, their habitations, and all their pleaſant things. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 15. The young Lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his Land waſte; his Cities are burnt without Inhabitant. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way? When <hi>Nicephorus Phocas</hi> had built a mighty ſtrong Wall about his Palace for his own ſecurity, in the night time
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40825:26"/> he heard a voice crying out unto him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. O Emperour, though thou buildeſt the wall as high as the clouds; yet if ſin be within, it will overthrow all. Sin, like thoſe Traitors in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, will do Cities &amp; Countries more hurt in one night, then ten thouſand open enemies could do in ten years. Cities and Countries might flouriſh, and continue as the days of Heaven, and be as the Sun before the Almighty, if his wrath be not provoked by their prophaneneſs and wickedneſs: So that it is not any divine Aſpect of the Heavens, nor any malignant Conjunction of the Stars and Planets, but the looſe manners, the ungracious lives, and the enormous ſins of men that lay Cities and Countries deſolate <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>And if thou ſay in thine heart, wherefore come theſe things upon me? wherefore hath the Lord ſent plague, ſword, famine, and fire to devour, and deſtroy, and to lay all in aſhes?</hi> The Anſwer is, <hi>For the greatneſs of thine iniquity.</hi> God will in flames of fire diſcover his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and indignation againſt ſin and ſinners. The Heathen <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> Hiſtorian obſerves in the ruine of <hi>Troy,</hi> that the ſparkles and aſhes of burnt <hi>Troy</hi> ſerved for a laſting monument of Gods great anger and diſpleaſure againſt great ſinners. The burning of <hi>Troy</hi> ſerved to teach men, that God puniſheth great ſinners with great plagues: and certainly <hi>Londons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid in aſhes, is a high evidence that God knows how to be angry with ſinners, and how to puniſh ſin with the ſoreſt of Judgments. The Gods of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſenſeleſs ſtocks and ſtones, not able to apprehend, much leſs to revenge any injury done unto them. Well therefore might the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher be bold with <hi>Hercules</hi> to put him to his thirteenth labour, in ſeething of his dinner; and <hi>Martial</hi> with <hi>Priapus,</hi> in threatning him to throw him into the fire, if he looked not well to his Trees. A child may play at the hole of a dead Aſp, and a filly woman may ſtrike a dead Lyon; but who dare play with a living Serpent? who dare take a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyon by the beard? O that Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtians then would take heed how they provoke the living God, for he is a conſuming fire, and with a word of his mouth, yea, with the breath of his mouth, he is able to throw down, and to burn up the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40825:26"/> whole frame of Nature, and to deſtroy all Creatures from the face of the Earth. Some Heathen Philoſophers thought anger an unſeemly Attribute to aſcribe to God. And ſome Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks conceived the God of the New Teſtament void of all anger. They imagined two Gods; the God of the Old Teſtament was in their account <hi>Deus juſtus,</hi> a Deity ſevere and revengeful: But the God of the New Teſtament was <hi>Deus bonus,</hi> the good God, a God made up all of mercy, they would have no anger in him: but Chriſtians do know, that God proclaims this Attribute among his Titles of Honour. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth, and is furious, he reſerveth wrath for his enemies.</hi> 'Tis the high-way to Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, to fancy to our ſelves a God made up all of mercy, to think that God cannot tell how to be angry and wroth with the ſons of men. Surely they that have ſeen <hi>London</hi> in flames, or believe that 'tis now laid in aſhes, they will believe that God knows how to be angry, and how to fix the tokens of his wrath upon us. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God inflicts great and ſore Judgments upon the ſons of men, and upon Cities and Countries, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> may ceaſe from ſin, receive inſtruction, and reform and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the moſt High; as you may evidently ſee by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Scriptures in the Margine together.

O Sirs! ſince God has turned our renowned City into aſhes, what diſcoveries has he made of that pride, that unbelief, that worldlineſs, that earthlineſs, that ſelf-love, that inordinate affection to relations, and to the good things of the world, that diſcontent, that diſquietneſs, that faint-heartedneſs, that has been cloſely wrapt up in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of many thouſands whoſe habitations are now laid in aſhes!

But,</p>

            <p> Sixthly, God inflicts great and ſore Judgments upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Perſons, Cities, and Countries, that others may be warned by his ſeverities to break off their ſins, and to return to the moſt High. Gods Judgments upon one City, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements to all other Cities to look about them, and to <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> tremble before him, who is a conſuming fire.

The Jews have a ſaying, That if war be begun in another Country, yet they ſhould faſt and mourn becauſe the war is begun, and becauſe they do not know how ſoon God may bring it to their doors. O Sirs! <hi>London</hi> is burnt, and it highly concerns you to faſt and mourn, and pray, and to take the Alarm; for you do not know how ſoon a fire may be kindled in your own habitations. Now God has made the (once famous) City of <hi>London</hi> a flaming Beacon before your eyes, he expects and looks that you ſhould all fear before him. Secure your intereſt in him, walk
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40825:29"/> humbly with him, and no more provoke the eyes of his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and glory. The deſign of Heaven by this late dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fire, is not to be confined to thoſe particular perſons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom it hath fallen heavieſt; but 'tis to awaken all, and warn all. When a Beacon is fired, it gives warning as much to the whole Country, as to him who ſets it on fire; or as it does to him on whoſe ground the Beacon ſtands. We can neither upon the foot of Reaſon or Religion, conclude them to be the greateſt ſinners, who have been the greateſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; for many times we find, that the greateſt Saints have been the greateſt ſufferers both from God and men. <hi>Job</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job. 1. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> was a non-ſuch in his day for holineſs, uprightneſs, and the fear of the Lord, and yet by the wind and fire from Heaven on the one hand, and by the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> on the other hand, he is ſtript of all his children and of a fair eſtate in one day: ſo that in the morning it might have been ſaid, Who ſo rich as <hi>Job?</hi> and in the evening, Who ſo poor as <hi>Job? Job</hi> was poor even to a Proverb. Look as wicked men are very incompetent Judges of divine favours and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo they are very incompetent Judges of divine tryals and ſeverities; and whatever they may think or ſay, I dare conclude, that they who have drank deepeſt of this Cup of ſorrows (of this Cup of deſolation and fire in <hi>London)</hi> are not greater ſinners then all others in <hi>England,</hi> who yet have not taſted of this bitter Cup. But more of this when I come to the Application of the Point. O Sirs! I beg upon the knee of my ſoul, that you will not ſlight this dreadful warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, that he has given to the whole Nation in turning <hi>London</hi> into aſhes: To that purpoſe ſeriouſly conſider. Firſt, Divine warnings ſlighted and neglected, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring down the greater wrath and vengeance upon you, <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 16, 17, 18. 21, 23, 24. 27, 28.

Secondly, Slighting of Judgments is the greateſt Judgment that can befal a people; it ſpeaks out much Pride, Atheiſm, Hardneſs, Blindneſs, and deſperate Security, and Contempt of the great God. To be given up to ſlight divine warnings, is a ſpiritual Judgment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt of all Judgments be the greateſt Judgment to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40825:30"/> given up to Sword, Famine, Fire, Peſtilence, burning Agues, and Fevers, is nothing ſo great a Judgment as to be given up to ſlight divine warnings; for in the one you are but paſſive, but in the other you are active. Thirdly, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <note place="margin">Jonah 3.</note> have trembled, and mended, and reformed at divine warnings; and therefore for you to ſlight them, is to act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Heathens, yea, 'tis to do worſe then the Heathens, who will certainly one day riſe up in Judgment againſt all ſuch who have been ſlighters of the dreadful warnings of Heaven. Fourthly, Slighting of divine warnings, lays men <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24. to verſ. 32.</note> open to ſuch anger and wrath, as all the Angels in Heaven are not able to expreſs, nor all the men on earth able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Fifthly, Slighting and neglecting of divine warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſpeaks out the greateſt diſ-ingenuity, ſtoutneſs, and ſtubbornneſs that is imaginable. The ingenuous child eaſily takes warning, and to an ingenuous Chriſtian every divine warning is as the hand-writing upon the wall. Sixthly, Slighting of divine warnings, provokes God many t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thou haſt a Devil; and wo to that man by whom the Son of Man ſhall be betrayed; it had been good for that man that he had never been born: But <hi>Judas</hi> ſlights all theſe warnings, and betrays his Lord and Maſter, and then goes forth and hangs himſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f. It was a ſtrange conceit of the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> that honoured <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor as ſome divine <note place="margin">Irenaeus. Aug. de Haereſi.</note> and ſuper-humane power, and called his Treaſon a bleſſed piece of Service, and that he knowing how much the death of Chriſt would profit mankind, did therefore betray him to death to ſave the race of mankind, and to do a thing pleaſing to God. <hi>Judas</hi> withſtood all divine warnings <note place="margin">Some report of <hi>Judas,</hi> that he ſlew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, married his mother, and betrayed his Maſter.</note> from within and without, and you know how the Tragedy ended; he dyed a miſerable death, he periſhed by his own hands, which were the moſt infamous hands in all the world: he went and hanged himſelf. And as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, he fell head-long and burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40825:30"/> bowels guſhed out. In every paſſage of his death we may take notice of divine Juſtice, and accordingly take heed of ſlighting divine warnings. It was but juſt that he ſhould hang in the air, who for his ſin was hated both of Heaven and Earth, and that he ſhould fall down head-long, who was fallen from ſuch a height of honour, as he was fallen from; and that the halter ſhould ſtrangle that throat, through which the voice of Treaſon had ſounded; and that his bowels ſhould be loſt, who had loſt the bowels of all pity, piety, and compaſſion; and that his Ghoſt ſhould have his paſſage out of his midſt (He burſt aſunder in the midſt, ſaith the Text) and not out of his lips, becauſe with a kiſs of his lips he had betrayed our Lord Jeſus. But ſeventhly, By ſlighting divine warnings, you will arm both viſible and <note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 8, 9, 10, 11. 16. 17. Exod. 14. Judg. 5. 19, 20.

When Iron grows ruſty, we put it into the fire to purifie it; and ſo when the people of God grow ruſty and ſecure, then the Lord brings them under fiery tryals to awaken them, and to purifie them. If <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo angry with <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> becauſe he ſlept at his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; how much more may the Lord be angry with all ſuch as ſleep and are ſecure under the moſt amazing and awakning Judgments? But my hope and prayer is, that the Lord has, and will more and more graciouſly and effectually awaken all the wiſe ſlumbring Virgins upon whom this fiery. Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation has paſt. And therefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of his peoples ſins, God has ſeveral ſpecial ends that he aims at by all the fiery Tryals and ſmart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Providences that he exerciſes them and others with. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, God by theſe means deſigns a further and a fuller diſcovery of their ſins. In ſtanding waters you cannot ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the mud that lyes at the bottom of the Pool or Pond; but <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 2.</note> when once the water is drawn away, then it appears. In
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40825:34"/> times of proſperity there is a great deal of mud, a great deal of Atheiſm, unbelief, diſcontent, murmuring, impatience, paſſion, pride, &amp;c. that lyes at the bottom of mens hearts undiſcovered. Oh but when God ſhall once empty them of their Eſtates, and burn up all their outward comforts, and ſet them with <hi>Job</hi> upon the dunghil, then the mud appears, then a whole army of luſts diſcover themſelves, as we ſee in many this day, whom you ſhall rarely find without tears in their eyes, ſighs in their hearts, and complaints in their mouths. Severe Providences are pills made purpoſely to clear the eye-ſight. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 18. <hi>And ſhe ſaid unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my ſin to remembrance, and to ſlay my ſon?</hi> If God had not taken away her ſon, her ſin had not been brought to remembrance. O Sirs! if God by this late dreadful Fire had not taken away your houſes, your goods, your eſtates, your trades, many of your ſins had not been brought to your remembrance, though now you have loſt moſt or all.

               <hi>ſins are ever before me:</hi> my pride is ever before me, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is ever before me, my frowardneſs is ever before me, my murmuring is ever before me, my diſcontent is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and my impatience is ever before me, &amp;c. Good men never come to know how bad they are, till they come to be exerciſed with ſevere Providences and ſmart Tryals It was the ſpeech of a Holy man in a great ſickneſs, In thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> diſeaſe I have learned how great God is, and what the evil of ſin is; I never knew to purpoſe what God was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor what ſin was before. Afflictions are a Chriſtians Glaſs, in which they may run and read the greatneſs of God, and the vileneſs of ſin. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, By ſevere Providences and fiery Tryals, God deſigns the preventing of ſin. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of the holieſt men on earth, called by ſome an earthly Angel, and yet he needed a thorn in the fleſh to prevent pride. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>And leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the</hi>

The <note place="margin">Job 33. 19-17. Chap. 34. 31, 32. Job 40. 4, 5. Hoſ. 2. 6, 7.</note> burnt child dreads the fire. Sin is but a bitter ſweet, 'tis an evil worſe then Hell it ſelf. Salt brine preſerves from putrefaction, and ſalt Marſhes keep the ſheep from rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and ſo ſharp Tryals, ſevere Providences preſerve the Saints from ſpiritual putrefying, and from ſpiritual rotting. The <hi>Rabbins,</hi> to keep their Scholars from ſin, were wont to tell them, that ſin made Gods head ake; and Saints under fiery tryals do find by experience, that ſin makes not only their heads, but alſo their hearts ake; and by this means God preſerves his people from many ſins, which otherwiſe they would certainly fall into. Beloved, God by his fiery Diſpenſations has deſtroyed many, or moſt of your outward comforts; but little do you know the horrible ſins that by this means the Lord has preſerved you from. A full Eſtate lays men moſt open to the greateſt ſins, the worſt of ſhares, and the deadlieſt temptations. The beſt of men have fallen fouleſt under their higheſt worldly enjoyments, witneſs <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vid, Solomon, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. Under your outward fulneſs, how low was your communion with God? how languiſhing were your Graces? how lean were your Souls? and how was your ſpring of inward Comforts dryed up? How little had God of your thoughts, your hearts, your time, your ſtrength? O Sirs! how bad would you have been by this time, if God had not removed thoſe things that were but fuel to your luſts, and quench-coals to your grace? Well, often think of this; 'tis a greater mercy to be preſerved from ſin, yea from the leaſt ſin, then 'tis to enjoy the whole world. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By ſevere Providences, and by fiery Tryals, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God deſigns the imbittering of ſin to his people. When God ſhall come and burn up mens comforts round about
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40825:35"/> them, then they will cry out, Ah, what a bitter thing is ſin! that puts God upon burning work; then they will ſpeak that language to their own Souls, that the Prophet once ſpake to the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>They made his land waſte: his cities are burnt with fire.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>Haſt thou not procured theſe things to thy ſelf?</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back-ſlidings ſhall reprove thee: know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> So Chap. 4. 18. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee: this is thy wickedneſs, becauſe it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thy heart</hi> Yea, now they will ſay, that ſin is bitterneſſes in the abſtract, and in the plural number alſo, according to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea, Hoſ.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Ephraim provoked him to anger moſt bitterly, or with bitterneſſes,</hi> as the Hebrew has it. Relations and friends may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing, and good books may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing, and men under terrours and horrours of ſpirit may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing, and the fore and heavy Judgments of God upon others may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing, and the Spirit by his ſecret whiſpers may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing, and Miniſters may tell us, that ſin is a bitter thing; they may tell you, that 'tis bitter to God, it being the only thing in all the world that he has revealed his wrath from Heaven againſt, and that is contrary to the Nature of God, the Law of God, the Being of God, the Glory of God, and the grand Deſigns of God. They may tell you, that 'tis bitter to Chriſt, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his crying out in the bitterneſs of his Soul, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and witneſs the ſorrows and heavineſs of his Soul, and his ſweating clods of blood. When he hung upon the Croſs, they gave him gall and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to drink; but no gall was ſo bitter to him as your ſins. They may tell you, that ſin is bitter to the Spirit of God; <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3. Eph. 4. 29.</note> for nothing grieves him, and provokes him, and vexes him but ſin. They may tell you, that ſin is bitter to the good Angels: every ſin that you commit is as a dagger at their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40825:36"/> hearts: there is nothing in all the world ſo bitter to them, as to ſee their Lord and Maſter daily, yea hourly crucified by ſinners fins. They may tell you, that ſin is bitter to the evil Angels, it being the only thing for which they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Court of Heaven, and turned down to the loweſt Hell, where they are kept in chains of darkneſs to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> of the great day. They may tell you, that ſin is bitter to the worſt of men, witneſs <hi>Adams</hi> hiding of himſelf, and <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 10. Math. 27. Gen. 4. 13. Rom. 8. 20, 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>Judas</hi> his hanging of himſelf, and <hi>Cains</hi> crying out, <hi>My burden is greater then I am able to bear.</hi> They may tell you, that 'tis bitter to the Creatures, who groan under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and who long to be delivered from that bondage that the ſin of man hath ſubjected them to; and yet for all this, we will not feelingly, affectionately, experimentally ſay, that ſin is bitter, till God comes and burns us up. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>And gives us gall and wormwood to drink.</hi> Chap. 3. 19, 20. <hi>Remembring mine affliction, and my miſery, the wormwood and the gall. My ſoul hath them ſtill in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi> O Sirs! how bitter ſhould ſin be to you, who have ſeen <hi>London</hi> all in flames? Certainly God by burning up your ſweet, pleaſant, and delightful things, would teach you to taſte a greater bitterneſs in ſin then ever. O happy Fire, that ſhall render God and Chriſt, and Heaven, and Promiſes, and Ordinances more ſweet, and ſin more bitter to poor ſinners Souls! Doubtleſs one of Gods great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by this late Judgment of Fire, is to imbitter ſin to all ſorts of men. When Judgments imbitter our ſins to us, then they work kindly, powerfully, effectually, and then we may conclude, that there was a hand of love in thoſe Judgments, and then we ſhall juſtifie the Lord, and ſay with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled againſt him:</hi> or as the Hebrew runs, <hi>Becauſe I have imbittered him, he is righteous in all the ſore judgments that he hath inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; for I have imbittered him againſt me by my moſt bitter ſins.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By ſevere Providences and fiery Tryals, God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> deſigns the mortifying and purging away of his peoples ſins. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>And I will turn my hand upon thee</hi> (to wit to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

The Jews who were once ſilver, were now turned into droſs and tin; but God by fiery tryals would burn up their droſs and tin, their enormities and wickedneſſes, and make them as ſhining Chriſtians in grace and holineſs, as ever they were.

But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By ſevere Providences and fiery Tryals, God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> deſigns theſe four things, in reſpect of his Childrens Graces.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He deſigns the reviving, quickning, and recovering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of their decayed graces: By fiery tryals he will inflame that love that was even key<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cold, and raiſe that faith that was <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4. Jam. 1. 2-12. 2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> fallen aſleep, and quicken up thoſe hopes that were languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and put life and ſpirits into thoſe joys and comforts that were withering and dying. God under fiery tryals lets his poor children ſee how that by their ſpiritual decays he has been diſhonoured, his Spirit grieved, Religion ſhamed, the mouths of the wicked opened, weak Saints ſtaggered, ſtrong Saints troubled, Conſcience wounded, and their Souls and Graces impaired; and by theſe diſcoveries he engages them to the uſe of all thoſe holy and heavenly helps, whereby their decayed graces may be revived and recovered. Many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have been frozen, and even dead with cold, have been revived and recovered by being brought to the fire. God by fiery tryals will unfreeze the frozen graces of his people, and put new life and ſpirits into them. As the Air is ſometimes clear, and ſometimes cloudy; and as the Sea is ſometimes ebbing, and ſometimes flowing; and as the tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:40825:38"/> of the field are ſomtimes flowering, green, and growing, and ſometimes naked, withered, and as it were even dead: So 'tis ſometimes with the graces of the Saints; but the Lord by one fiery tryal or another will revive, and recover, and raiſe their graces again. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> makes mention of thoſe that <note place="margin">Lib. de Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> travel by the Deſarts of <hi>Syria,</hi> where are nothing but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Marſhes and Sands, deſtitute of all Commodities, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be had for love or money. Now if it ſo happen, that their fire go out by the way, then they light it again at the heat of the Sun, by the means of a Burning-glaſs: and thus if the fire of zeal, if the ſparks of divine grace, by the prevalency of ſome ſtrong corruption, or by the violence of ſome dreadful temptation, ſhould be put out, or dye as to its lively operations; by a Burning-glaſs, or by one fiery Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation or another, God will inflame the zeal, and enliven the dying graces of his poor people. I know the ſaving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as Faith, Love, Hope, &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9. 11. Rom. 29. 13. Heb. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 5.

               </gap>r light, nor ſmoak, nor heat may appear; and yet when the embers, the aſhes are ſtirred to the bottom, then live coals appear, and by a little blowing, a flame breaks forth. There are ſeveral caſes wherein grace in a Chriſtians breaſt may ſeem to be hid, cold, dead, and covered over; as ſap in the winter is hid in the roots of trees, or as flowers and fruits are hid in the ſeeds, or roots in the earth, or as ſparks of fire are hid in the aſhes, or as bits of gold are hid in a duſt heap, or as pearls may be hid in the mire. I, but God by one ſevere providence or another, by one fiery tryal or another, will blow that heavenly grace, that divine fire into a perfect flame: he will cauſe their hid graces to revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine, and bloſſom as the Lilly, and ſmell as the Wine of <hi>Lebanon, Hoſ.</hi> 14 5, 6, 7. O Sirs! how many Chriſtians were there amongſt us, who were much decayed and withered in their graces, in their duties, in there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40825:38"/> in their comforts, in their ſpiritual enjoyments, in their <note place="margin">As a man may take infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or get ſome inward bruiſe, or ſpring a vein, and yet not know of it.</note> communions with God, and with one another; and yet were not ſenſible of their decays, nor humbled under their decays, nor induſtrious to recover themſelves out of their withering and dying condition? and therefore no wonder, if the Lord to recover them and raiſe them, hath brought fiery tryals upon them. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, God by ſevere Providences and by fiery Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deſigns a further exerciſe of his Childrens graces; ſleepy habits bring him no glory, nor do us no good. All the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he has, and all the advantage we have in this world, is from the active part of grace: conſult the Scriptures in the <note place="margin">Job 15. 3. 2 Chron. 20. 12, 13. Jam. 1. 4. Chap. 5. 11. Hab. 2. 3, 4. Mich. 7. 7, 8, 9. Rev. 13. 10. compared with Chap. 14. 12.</note> Margine. There is little difference (as to the comfort and ſweet of grace) between grace out of exerciſe, and no grace at all.

The ſtrongeſt Creature the Lyon, and the ſubtleſt Creature the Serpent, if they are dormant, are as eaſily ſurpriſed and deſtroyed as the weakeſt worm: So the ſtrongeſt Saints, if grace be not in exerciſe, are as eaſily ſurpriſed and captivated by Sin, Satan, and the World, as the weakeſt Saints are.

Well, Sirs, you had not long ſince many outward comforts to live upon, but the Lord has now burnt them up, that ſo he might lead you forth to live in a daily exerciſe of grace upon himſelf, upon his power, upon his all-ſufficiency, his goodneſs, his faithfulneſs, his fulneſs, his graciouſneſs, his unchangeableneſs, his promiſes. And if this fiery Diſpenſation ſhall be ſo ſanctified to us, as to work us to a further activity of grace, and to a further growth and increaſe of grace, we ſhall be happy Citizens, though we are burnt Citizens. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By ſevere Providences and by fiery Tryals, God deſigns the growth of his people in grace. Uſually the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Saints thrive beſt when they are under a ſmarting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Rod. Grace uſually is in the greateſt flouriſh, when the Saints are under the ſoreſt tryals. The ſnuffing of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle makes it burn the brighter. God beats and bruiſes his links to make them burn the brighter; he bruiſes his ſpices <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> to make them ſend forth the greater aromatical ſavour. Fiery tryals are like the Tezel, which though it be ſharp and ſcratching, it is to make the cloth more pure and fine. God would not rub ſo hard, were it not to fetch out the dirt and ſpots that be in his people. The Jews were always beſt when they were in their loweſt condition. Well-waters ariſing from deep Springs, are hotter in the Winter then they are in the Summer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights; and ſo do the graces of the Saints ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights of affliction and tribulation. God will ſometimes more car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the growth of grace by a Croſs then by an Ordinance; yea, the Lord will firſt or laſt, more or leſs, turn all fiery
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40825:40"/> tryals into Ordinances for the helping on the growth of <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10. Jam. 1. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7.</note> grace in his peoples ſouls. Look as in the lopping of a tree, there ſeems to be a kind of diminution and deſtruction; yet the end and iſſue of it is better growth: And as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the body by Phyſick, ſeems to tend to death; yet it produceth better health, and more ſtrength: And as the ball by falling downward, riſeth upward; and as water in pipes deſcends, that it may aſcend: So the Saints ſpiritual growth in grace is carried on by ſuch divine methods, and in ſuch ways as might ſeem to deaden grace, and weaken it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any ways to augment and increaſe it. We know that winter is as neceſſary to bring on harveſt, as the ſpring: and ſo fiery tryals are as neceſſary to bring on the harveſt of grace, as the ſpring of mercy is. Though fiery tryals are grievous; yet they ſhall make us more gracious. Though for the preſent we cannot ſee but that ſuch and ſuch ſevere providences and fiery tryals, as the loſs of houſe, eſtate, trade, friends, will redound much to our prejudice and damage; yet in the iſſue we ſhall find, that God will turn <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> them to the internal and eternal advantage of our precious <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 36.

When they ſee that thoſe whom they have ſeverely judged for Hypocrites, ſhall owne the Lord and his ways, and cleave to the Lord and his ways, and continue to follow the Lord and his ways, and hold on in a high honouring of the Lord and his ways, when their hedge is broken down, and God has ſtript them as naked as in the day wherein they were born; O now they begin to <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 26. Acts 16. 17.</note> change their note, and to conclude, ſurely theſe are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the moſt high God; theſe are no Hypocrites nor Diſſemblers, but true <hi>Nathanaels</hi> in whom there is no guile. <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 47.</note> How have the people of God in <hi>London</hi> been judged Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Diſſemblers, Deceivers, Factious, and what not? Now God by burning up their ſubſtance, and by turning them out of houſe and home, and deſtroying all their pleaſant things, doth certainly deſign to give thoſe that have ſo deeply cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them, a proof of their integrity and ſincerity, by letting them ſee, that all the changes that have paſt upon them, can never work them to change their Maſter Chriſt, nor to change his ways for the ways of ſin, nor to change his Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip for the Worſhip of the world, nor to change their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for the Religion of <hi>Rome.</hi> Certainly thoſe that love

There is nothing that doth more amuſe, amaze, and aſtoniſh wicked men, then to ſee the people of God keep cloſe to him and his ways, when they are in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering eſtate; yea, when they have loſt all but their God and their integrity.

               </gap>ver, Honour, City, &amp;c. for thou art all, and much more then all theſe to me. Here was an Heroick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, here was grace in ſtrength, yea, in triumph. The ſpirits of the men of the world uſually ſink under their loſſes. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nippus</hi> of <hi>Phenicia</hi> having loſt his goods, ſtrangled himſelf. <hi>Dinarcus Phiton</hi> at a certain loſs cut his own throat to ſave the charge of a Halter. Another being turned out of his Eſtate, ran out of his wits. And another for the death of his Son, threw himſelf head-long into the Sea. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> (in whoſe time Chriſt was born) was ſo troubled and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the relation of a Foyl and Overthrow from <hi>Varus,</hi> that for certain months together he let the hair of his beard and head grow ſtill, and wore it long; yea, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> he would run his head againſt the doors, crying out, <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> deliver up my Legions again; <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> deliver up my Legions again. <hi>Henry</hi> the II.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40825:43"/> to be taken from me. Now by all theſe inſtances you may clearly and plainly ſee the different temper and carriage of wicked men under their loſſes, croſſes, tryals, and ſufferings, from the people of God. When they are under fiery tryals, what an evil ſpirit, what a deſperate ſpirit, what a ſullen ſpirit, what a proud ſpirit, what a Satanical ſpirit, what a helliſh ſpirit do they diſcover! they tell all the world, that they are under the power and dominion of the God of this <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 2. 2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> World. But when the people of God are under fiery tryals, they make conſcience of carrying of it ſo as that they may convince the world, that God is in them of a truth, and that they are ſincere and upright before the Lord, however they are judged and cenſured as Hypocrites, Deceivers, Diſſemblers, and what not. O that all that are ſufferers by this fiery Diſpenſation, would make it their buſineſs, their work, their Heaven, ſo to carry it under their preſent try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as to convince all gain-ſayers of the ſincerity, integrity, and uprightneſs of their hearts, both towards the Lord, his people, his ways, his Ordinances, his intereſt, and all his concernments in this world.

            <p>The next thing we are to inquire after, is, thoſe ſins for which the Lord inflicts ſo heavy a Judgment as this of Fire upon the Sons of men. Now for the opening of this, give me leave to propoſe this Queſtion. <hi>Viz.</hi>

               </gap>eſtion, will you pleaſe to premiſe with me theſe four things?</p>
            <p>Firſt, We need not queſtion but that ſome of all ſorts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ranks, and degrees of men (in and about that once great and glorious City) did eminently contribute to the bringing down of that dreadful Judgment of Fire that has turned that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40825:44"/> renowned City into Aſhes; doubtleſs Superiors and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, Miniſters and People, Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, Rich and Poor, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Baſe, Bond and Free, have all had a hand in the bringing down that Judgment of Fire that has turned <hi>London</hi> into a ruinous heap. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Premiſe this with me, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis a greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Argument of humility, integrity, and holy ingenuity, to fear our ſelves, and to be jealous of our ſelves rather then others, as the Diſciples of Chriſt did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 21, 22. <hi>And as they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 26. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>did eat, he ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, that one of you ſhall betray me. And they were exceeding ſorrowful, and began eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them to ſay unto him, Lord, is it I?</hi> 'Tis better for every man to do his beſt to ranſack and ſearch his own Soul, and to find out the <hi>Achan,</hi> the accurſed thing in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 40. Joſhua 7.</note> that has brought that dreadful Judgment of Fire upon us, then for men (without any Scripture-warrant) to fix it upon this party and that, this ſort of men and that. There is no Chriſtian to him that ſmites upon his own heart, his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eaſt, his own thigh, ſaying, What have I done? The neglect of this duty the Prophet long ſince has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of. <hi>No man repents himſelf of his wickedneſs, ſaying,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 8. 6.</note> 
               <hi>What have I done?</hi> that is, none comparatively: So how rare is it to find a burnt Citizen repenting himſelf of his wickedneſs, and ſaying, What have I done? Moſt men are ready to blame others more then themſelves, and to judge <note place="margin">Math. 7. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> others rather then themſelves to be the perſons that have brought down this Judgment of Fire upon us. 'Twas a good Saying of one of the Ancients: <hi>Amat Deus ſeipſos ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicantes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>non judicare;</hi> God loves to judge them that judge others raſhly, but not thoſe that judge themſelves religiouſly. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Premiſe this with me; in times of common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Judgements, common Calamities, and Miſeries, other of the Saints and Servants of God have lookt upon their own ſins as the procuring-cauſes of the common Calamity: Thus <hi>David</hi> did in that 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>So the Lord ſent a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>

               <hi>upon Iſrael from the morning even to the time appointed, and there dyed of the people from Dan even to Beer-ſheba ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men:</hi> but mark the 17. verſe, <hi>And David ſpake unto the Lord, when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the people, and ſaid, Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly; but theſe ſheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be againſt me and againſt my fathers houſe.</hi> And thus did good <hi>Nebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Nehem.</hi> 1. 3 6, 7. <hi>And they ſaid unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach, the wall of Jeruſalem alſo is broken down, and the gates thereof burnt with fire. Both I and my fathers houſe have ſinned, we have dealt very corruptly againſt thee, and have not kept thy commandments, nor the ſtatutes, nor the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou commandeſt thy ſervant Moſes.</hi> Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis as much our glory as our duty to write after theſe bleſſed Copies, that theſe Worthies have ſet before us. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had ſomewhat a wry neck, and his Souldiers thought it an honour to be like him: How much more ſhould we count it an honour to be like to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in ſuch a practice as is honourable to the Lord, and advantagious to our ſelves? But what <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> That he was excellent at praiſing the worthy Acts of his Anceſtors, but not ſo at imitating them, is applicable to the preſent caſe, and to many who have been burnt up in our day. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Premiſe this with me; there were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> many ſins amongſt them that did profeſs to fear God in that great City, which may and ought to work them to juſtifie the Lord, and to ſay, that he is righteous in his fiery Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. I may well ſay to the burnt Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> what the Prophet <hi>Oded</hi> to them in that 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 10. <hi>But are there not with you, even with you, ſins againſt the Lord your God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, What ſins were there among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people in <hi>London,</hi> that may and ought to work them to juſtifie the Lord, and to ſay, that he is juſt and righteous, and that he has done them no wrong, though he has burnt them up, and turned them out of all?</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40825:45"/>
            <p> I anſwer, That there were theſe ſeven ſins, among others, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> to be found amongſt many of them (I ſay not amongſt all of them) all which call aloud upon them to lye low at the foot of God, and to ſubſcribe to the Righteouſneſs of God, though he has turned them out of houſe and home, and burnt up their ſubſtance on every hand.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was among many Profeſſors of the Goſpel in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>London,</hi> too great a conformity to the faſhions of the world; how many profeſſing men in that great City were dreſt up like fantaſtical Anticks, and women like <hi>Bartholomew-babies,</hi> to the diſhonour of God, the ſhame of Religion, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wicked, the grieving of the weak, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking of divine Juſtice? When <hi>Darius</hi> changed the faſhion of his Scabbard from the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner into the Mode of the Greeks, the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Aſtrologers prognoſticated that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy ſhould be tranſlated to them whoſe faſhion he counterfeited. Certainly that Nation may fear a ſcourge from that Nation or Nations whoſe faſhions they follow. <hi>Zepha.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the day of the Lords Sacrifice, that I will puniſh the Princes and the Kings children, and all ſuch as are cloathed with ſtrange apparel.</hi> This is a ſtinging and a flaming check againſt all Faſhion-mongers, againſt all ſuch as ſeem to have conſulted with <hi>French, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Perſian,</hi> and all Outlandiſh Monſters to adviſe them of all their ſeveral modes and faſhions of vice, and that are ſo dextrous at following of them, that they are more compleat in them then their pattern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I have read of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that when they wiſhed a curſe upon their enemies, it was this, That they ſhould pleaſe themſelves in bad cuſtoms. There are many who lift their heads high, who ſeem to be under this curſe this day. Why doth the Apoſtle ſay (ſaith one of the Ancients) <hi>Above all things ſwear not?</hi> Is it worſe <note place="margin">

No, But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would fortifie us as much as he could againſt a poſtilent cuſtom, to puniſh the peſtilent cuſtoms and faſhions that were amongſt us. God ſent the Peſtilence in 1665. and the fiery Judgment in 1666. And the Lord grant that the bloody Sword (in the hands of cruel Cut-throats that are brutiſh and skilful to deſtory) be not ſent amongſt us ſome <note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 31.</note> other year to puniſh the ſame iniquity. O Sirs! what was more common among many Profeſſors in <hi>London</hi> then to be cloathed in ſtrange Apparel, <hi>A la mode de France.</hi> Mark thoſe that affected the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Habit, were ſent Captives <note place="margin">Ezek. 23. 15.</note> to <hi>Babylon.</hi> They that borrowed the faſhions of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> may get their boils and botches. Certainly ſuch as fear the Lord ſhould go in no Apparel, but, Firſt ſuch as they are willing to dye in.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſtand before a Judgment-ſeat. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was among many Profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in <hi>London</hi> much luke-warmneſs and coldneſs in the things

God deſtroyed the old World by water for the heat of their luſts, and God has deſtroyed the City of <hi>London</hi> by fire for the coldneſs of their love that dwelt therein. I have read of <hi>Anaſtati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, There was a great deal of worldlineſs and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> earthly-mindedneſs, and coyetouſneſs amongſt the profeſſing people of <hi>London.</hi> O Sirs! the world is all ſhadow and vanity, 'tis <hi>filia noctis,</hi> like <hi>Jonabs</hi> Gourd, a man may ſet <note place="margin">Jonah 4.</note> under its ſhadow for a time, but it ſoon decays and dyes. The main reaſon why many Profeſſors dote upon the world, is, becauſe they are not acquainted with a greater glory. Men ate Acorns till they were acquainted with the uſe of Wheat. The Load-ſtone cannot draw the Iron when the Diamond is in preſence; and ſhall earthly vanities draw the Soul when Chriſt the Pearl of price is in preſence? Many of the Proſeſſors of <hi>London</hi> were great Worſhippers of the golden Calf, and therefore God is juſt in turning their gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Calf into aſhes. The world may well be reſembled to the fruit that undid us all, which was fair to the ſight, ſmooth in handling, ſweet in taſte, but deadly in effect and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

If the heart of man be not filled with the three Perſons in Trinity, it will be filled with the world, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7.</note> the fleſh, and the Devil. Riches, like bad ſervants, never ſtay long with one maſter; what certainty is there in that which one ſtorm at Sea, one treacherous friend, one falſe cath, one ball of fire, yea, one ſpark of fire may ſtrip us of? O Sirs! if you can gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thiſtles, then go on, and dote upon the world ſtill.

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40825:46"/> all in Heaven count them vain, and all in Hell count them vain: a <hi>Jacobus</hi> piece is but as a chip to them, Pearls are but as pebbles in their eyes. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was a Preacher, as ſome conceive, and <hi>Dives</hi> a Lawyer: ſure I am, that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in Heaven is now rich enough, and happy enough; and <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell is now poor enough, and miſerable enough.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40825:47"/> Scriptures in the Margine together. Many Worldings deal <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 10. Jer. 5. 7. Deut. 32. 15. Hoſ. 4 7. Hoſ. 13. 6.</note> with Religion as Maſons deal with their Ladders, when they have work to do, and to climb, &amp;c. O then how they hug and embrace the Ladder, and carry it on their arms and on their ſhoulders! but then when they have done climbing, they hang the Ladder on the Wall, or throw it into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. O Sirs! there is no loſs to the loſs of Religion; a man were better loſe his name, his eſtate, his limbs, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, his life, his all, then loſe his Religion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To the loſs of Communion with God, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with God. A man whoſe Soul is converſant <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 10, 11. Jer. 2. 31. Chap. 22. 21. Pſal. 144. 15.</note> with God, ſhall find more pleaſure, delight, and content in a deſart, in a den, in a dungeon, and in death, then in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of a Prince. Mans <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> ſtands in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, as Scripture and Experience evidences; nay, God and I are good company, ſaid famous Doctor <hi>Sibs Macedonius</hi> the Hermit, retiring into the Wilderneſs, that he might with more freedom enjoy God, and have his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven; upon a time there came a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman into the Wilderneſs to hunt wild beaſts, and ſeeing he Hermit, he rode to him, asking him, why he came into that ſolitary place? he deſired he might have leave to ask him the ſame queſtion, why he came thither? I came hither to hunt, ſaid the young Gallant, and ſo do I, ſaith the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>Deum venor meum,</hi> I hunt after my God: they hunt beſt who hunt moſt after Communion with God. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus Regius</hi> having one days converſe with <hi>Luther,</hi> ſaid, it was <note place="margin">

Now an inordinate love of the world will eat out all a mans Communion with God. A man cannot look up to Heaven, and look down upon the Earth at the ſame time. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, To the loſs of his precious and immortal Soul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
               <hi>Shemei</hi> by ſeeking his ſervant, loſt his life; and many by <note place="margin">Math. 16. 26. 1 Tim. 6. 9.</note> an eager ſeeking after this world, loſe their precious and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40825:47"/> immortal Souls. Many have ſo much to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n Earth, that they have no time to look up to Heaven to honour their God, to ſecure their Intereſt in Chriſt, or to make ſure work for their Souls. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, To the loſs of the world; for by their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> love of the world, they highly provoke God to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ip them of the world. Ah, how rich might many a man have been, had he minded Heaven more, and the world leſs! When men ſet their hearts ſo greedily upon the world, 'tis juſt with God to blaſt, and curſe, and burn up all their worldly comforts round about them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Many in <hi>London</hi> were fallen under ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> witherings, and languiſhings in their graces, in their comforts, in their communions, and in their ſpiritual ſtrength. They are fallen from their firſt love. The flame of divine <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4. The Nutmeg tree makes barren all the ground about it; ſo doth the ſpice of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love make the heart bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of grace. <hi>

Many <hi>Londoners</hi> were fallen into a ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and to recover them out of it, God ſent a fire amongſt them. Many in <hi>London</hi> were withered in their very Profeſſion: where was that viſible forwardneſs, that zeal, that diligence in waiting upon the Lord in his Ordinances, that once was to be found amongſt the Citizens of <hi>London?</hi> And many Citizens were withered in their Converſations and Converſe one with another. There was not that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, that holineſs, that ſpiritualneſs, that heavenlineſs, that fruitfulneſs, that examplarineſs, that ſeriouſneſs, and that profitableneſs ſparkling and ſhining in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Converſe one with another, as once was to be found amongſt them. And many were withered in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons. Ah, what a flame of love, what a flame of joy, what a flame of deſires, what a flame of delight, what a flame of zeal as to the beſt things, was once to be found amongſt the Citizens of <hi>London!</hi> but how were thoſe mighty flames of affection reduced to a few coals and cinders? and therefore no wonder, if God ſent a flaming fire in the midſt of them; and many were withered in their very Duties and Services,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40825:48"/> how ſlight, how formal, how cold, how careleſs, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, how neglective were many in their Families, in their Cloſets, and in their Church-communions, who heretofore were mighty in praying and wreſtling with God, and mighty in lamenting and mourning over ſin, and mighty in their groanings and longings after the Lord; and who of old would have taken the Kingdom of Heaven by violence? <note place="margin">Math. 11. 12.</note> There were many in that great City that had loſt their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual taſte, they could not taſte that ſweetneſs in Promiſes, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 35</note> in Ordinances, in Sabbaths, and in the Communion of Saints, that once they had taſted and found. In ſpiritual things many Citizens could taſte no more ſweetneſs then in the white of an Egg. Many in that great City had loſt their <note place="margin">Job 6. 6.</note> ſpiritual appetite, they had loſt their ſtomachs, they did not hunger and thirſt after God and Chriſt, and the Spirit and Grace, and the Light of Gods Countenance, and pure Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the Fellowſhip of the people of God, as once they did. Now is there any thing more contrary to the Nature of God, the Works of God, the Word of God, the Glory of God, then ſpiritual decays? Oh, the prayers and the praiſes that God loſes by decayed Chriſtians! Ah, how do decayed Chriſtians grieve the ſtrong, and ſtumble the weak, and ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, and lay themſelves open to divine diſpleaſure! Many in <hi>London</hi> did like <hi>Mandro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who offered to his God the firſt year gold, the ſecond year ſilver, and the third year nothing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder, if God ſent a fire amongſt them. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Their non-improvement of the mercies and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that they were ſurrounded with, and their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improvement of leſſer and greater Judgments that God had formerly inflicted on them, and thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> non improvement of their Eſtates to that height they ſhould have done, for the ſupply of them whoſe wants, bonds, neceſſities, and miſeries did call aloud for ſupplies: many did ſomething, a few did much, but all ſhould have done more.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Thoſe unnatural heats, fiery conteſts, violent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> paſſions, and ſore diviſions that have been amongſt them,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40825:48"/> may well work them to juſtifie the Lord in his fiery Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations towards them: for a Wolf to worry a Lamb, is uſual; but for one Lamb to worry another, is unnatural: <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 16.</note> for Chriſts lillies to be among thorns, is common; but for theſe lillies to become thorns, and to tear and rend, and fetch blood of one another, is monſtrous and ſtrange. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that was between the Birds, about the Roſe that was found in the way, was fatal to many of them, and iſſued in the loſs of the Roſe at laſt.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, There were many in <hi>London,</hi> who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> were ſo very ſecure, and ſo exceſſively taken up with their worldly comforts, contentments, and enjoyments, that they did not lay the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> 1, ſo kindly, 2. ſo <note place="margin">Amos 6. 6.</note> ſeriouſly, 3. ſo affectionately, 4. ſo readily, 5. ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, 6. ſo lamentingly, and 7. ſo conſtantly to heart as they ought to have done. Upon all theſe accounts, how well does it become the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> to cry out, the Lord is righteous, the Lord is righteous in all his fiery Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations towards us?</p>
            <p>But to prevent miſtakes, and that I may lay no heavier a load upon the people of God, that truly feared him, and that had and have a ſaving intereſt in him, then is meet; and that I may give no advantage to prophane perſons to father the burning of the City of <hi>London</hi> wholly, mainly, or only upon the ſins of the people of God: give me leave therefore to propound theſe four Queries.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether all theſe ſeven ſins laſt cited, or moſt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them, can be juſtly charged upon the body of thoſe ſincere Chriſtians, who lived then in <hi>London,</hi> and whoſe habitations are now burnt up?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether thoſe of the people of God, upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whom any of the fore-mentioned ſins are chargeable, have not before the City was burnt, daily lamented, bewailed, and mourned over thoſe ſins that might have been charged upon them, either by their own conſciences or others?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Where and how it doth appear by the bleſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:40825:49"/> Scriptures, that ever God ſent ſo great a Judgment of Fire (as was poured out upon <hi>London)</hi> upon the account of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ins of thoſe that truly feared him; be it thoſe ſeven that have been already ſpecified, or any others that can be now clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly and juſtly proved againſt them?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Whether there are not ſome other mens ſins, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> upon whom in the clear evidence of Scripture-light, this heavy Judgment of Fire may be more clearly, ſafely, and fairly fixt, then upon the ſins of thoſe, who had ſet up God as the great Object of their fear?</p>
            <p>Now in Anſwer to this laſt Query, give me leave to ſay:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſin in the general brings the dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire upon a people; marks, perſonal afflictions, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yals may come upon the people of God for tryal, and to ſhew the Soveraignty of God, as in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> whoſe <note place="margin">Job 1. John 9.</note> afflictions were for tryal, and not for ſin: the ſame may be ſaid of the man that was born blind. But general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as this fiery Diſpenſation was, never comes upon a people, but upon the account of ſin. This is evident in my Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 24, 25. <hi>God ſet Jacob and Iſrael on fire, and burnt them round about, but 'twas becauſe they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his Law.</hi> Jer. 4. 4. <hi>Circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord, and take away the fore-skin of your heart, ye men of Judah, and inhabitants of Jeruſalem, leſt my fury come forth like fire, and burn, that none can quench it, becauſe of the evil of your doings.</hi> So Pſal. 107. 33, 34. <hi>He turneth rivers into a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Ah, what ruines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oth ſin bring upon the moſt renowned Countries and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies that have been in the world! ſuch is the deſtructive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, that it will firſt or laſt level the richeſt, the ſtrongeſt, and the moſt glorious Cities in the world. So the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> tells us, that 'tis ſin that brings Gods
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40825:49"/> ſoreſt puniſhments upon his people, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 3. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Damaſcus</hi> (by which we are to underſtand the greatneſs of their iniquities) <hi>and for four</hi> (by which we are to underſtand the multitude of their tranſgreſſions) <hi>I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof:</hi> the ſame is ſaid of <hi>Gaza,</hi> verſe 6. and of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> verſe 9. and of <hi>Edom,</hi> verſe 11. and of <hi>Ammon,</hi> verſe 13. and of <hi>Moab,</hi> Chap. 2. 1. and of <hi>Judah,</hi> verſe 4. and of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſe 6. Now 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable of every one of theſe, that when God threatens to puniſh them for the greatneſs of their iniquities, and for the multitude of their tranſgreſſions, he doth particularly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſend a fire among them, to conſume the houſes and the Palaces of their Cities; ſo he doth to <hi>Damaſcus, Amos</hi> 1. 4. <hi>But I will ſend a fire into the houſe of Hazael, which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Palaces of Ben-hadad:</hi> So he doth to <hi>Gaza,</hi> verſe 7. <hi>But I will ſend a fire on the Wall of Gaza, which ſhall devour the Palaces thereof:</hi> So he doth to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>But I will ſend a fire on the Wall of Tyrus, which ſhall devour the Palaces thereof:</hi> So he doth to <hi>Edom,</hi> verſe 12. <hi>But I will ſend a fire upon Teman, which ſhall devour the Palaces of Boz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah:</hi> So he doth to <hi>Ammon,</hi> verſe 14. <hi>But I will kindle a fire in the Wall of Rabbah, and it ſhall devour the Palaces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with ſhouting in the day of battel, with a tempeſt in the day of the whirlwind:</hi> So he doth to <hi>Moab,</hi> Chap. 2. verſ. 2. <hi>But I will ſend a fire upon Moab, and it ſhall devour the Palaces of Kirioth, and Moab ſhall dye with tumult, with ſhouting, and with the ſound of a trumpet:</hi> So he doth to <hi>Judah,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>But I will ſend a fire upon Judah, and it ſhall devour the Palaces of Jeruſalem.</hi> By all theſe remarkable Inſtances tis evident, that God by his fiery Diſpenſations tells all the world, that the ſins of that people are great and many, upon whom the dreadful Judgment of Fire is inflicted in its fury, and therefore 'tis high folly and madneſs in many men that makes them impute this heavy Judgment of Fire to any thing rather then to their ſins. O Sirs! 'tis ſin that burns up our habitations, and that turns flames of love into a conſuming fire. And this the Parliament in their Act for the Rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the City of <hi>London,</hi> well obſerves: the Clauſe of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40825:50"/> Act is this: <q>And that the ſaid Citizens, and their Succeſſors for all the time to come, may retain the Memorial of ſo ſad a deſolation, and reflect ſeriouſly upon their manifold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, which are the unhappy cauſes of ſuch Judgments. Be it further Enacted, That the Second of <hi>September</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſame happen to be Sunday; and if ſo, then the next day following) be yearly for ever hereafter obſerved as a day of publick Faſting and Humiliation within the ſaid City and Liberties thereof, to implore the mercies of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God upon the ſaid City, to make devout Prayers and Supplications unto him, to divert the like Calamity for the time to come.</q> So Sir <hi>Edward Turnor</hi> Knight, in his Speech to the King upon the Prorogation of the Parliament, <q>We muſt (ſaith he) for ever with humility acknowledge the Juſtice of God in puniſhing this whole Nation by the late dreadful Conflagration of <hi>London.</hi> We know they were not the greateſt ſinners on whom the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, <note place="margin">Luke 13. 4.</note> and doubtleſs all our ſins did contribute to the filling up that meaſure, which being full, drew down the wrath of God upon that City.</q> So much the King in his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a General Faſt on the Tenth of <hi>October</hi> obſerves. The Words of the Proclamation are theſe. <q>His Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of out a deep and pious ſenſe of what Himſelf and all His People now ſuffer, and with a Religious care to prevent what may yet be feared, unleſs it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God to turn away his anger from us, doth hereby Publiſh and Declare His Royal Will and Pleaſure, That <hi>Wedneſday</hi> being the Tenth of <hi>October</hi> next enſuing, ſhall be ſet apart, and kept, and obſerved by all His Majeſties Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> as a day of ſolemn Faſting and Humiliation, to implore the mercies of God, that it would pleaſe him to pardon the crying ſins of this Nation, thoſe eſpecially which have drawn down this laſt and heavy Judgment upon us, and to remove from us all other his Judgments which our ſins have deſerved, and which we now either feel or fear.</q> Thus you ſee that not only the bleſſed Scriptures, but alſo King and Parliament do roundly conclude, that 'twas for our ſins,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40825:50"/> our manifold iniquities, our crying ſins, that God has ſent this heavy Judgment upon us. His Majeſty alſo well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that there are ſome ſpecial crying ſins that bring down the fiery Judgment upon us. Now this Royal Hint leads me by the hand to ſay:</p>
            <p>Secondly, That though ſin in the general, lays people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the fiery Diſpenſations of God; yet if we will but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearch into the bleſſed Book of God, which never ſpoke Treaſon nor Sedition, we ſhall find that there are ſeveral ſins that brings the heavy Judgment of Fire upon Cities and Countries. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Groſs Atheiſm, practical Atheiſm, is a ſin that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> brings deſolating and deſtroying Judgments upon a people, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, at that time that I will</hi>

What a God of Clouts, what an Idol-god do they make the great God to be, when they make him to be ſuch a God as will neither do good nor hurt? <hi>Epicurius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not Gods Eſſence, but only his Providence; for he granted that there was a God, though he thought him to be ſuch an one as did neither good nor evil; but certainly God ſits not idle in Heaven, but has a ſharp and ſerious Eye upon all that is done on the Earth: and this both Saints and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall find by experience, when in the great day he ſhall diſtribute both his rewards and puniſhments according to what they have done in the fleſh.

Now what abundance of ſuch Atheiſts were there within and without

The Scripture attributes the ruine of the old world to <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs; and why may not I attribute the ruine and deſolation of <hi>London</hi> to the ſame.

            <p>But to prevent all miſtakes in a buſineſs of ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, give me leave to ſay, That if we ſpeak of Atheiſts in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, as meaning ſuch as have ſimply and conſtantly denied all Deity, then I muſt ſay, that there was never any ſuch creature in the world as ſimply and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to deny that there is a God. It is an inviolable principle, and indelebly ſtampt upon mans nature, that there is a God. They that ſhall deny that there is a God, muſt extinguiſh the very Light of Nature, by which the very Heathen in all the Ages of the World, have acknowledged a ſupream divine Being. <hi>Bion</hi> of <hi>Boriſteneſa</hi> was a very great <note place="margin">Laert.</note> Atheiſt all his life time, he denied the Gods, deſpiſed their Temples, and derided their Worſhip; yet when death <note place="margin">The ſtouteſt Atheiſts that ever lived, cannot reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no God; hence Heathens have condemned ſome to death that denied there was a God.</note> came, he would rather have endured the greateſt torment, then to have dyed, and that not ſo much for fear of a natural death, but for fear of what followed after, leſt God whom he had denied, ſhould give him up into the hand of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil whom he had ſerved; and therefore at the time of his death he put forth his hand, crying, <hi>Salve, Pluto, ſalve,</hi> Welcome, Devil, welcome, fooliſhly thinking to pacific the Devil by this flattering ſalutation. And <hi>Tully</hi> obſerves of <hi>Epicurius,</hi> that though no man ſeemed more to contemn both God and death; yet no man feared more both the one and the other. The Philoſophers did with one conſent affirm, That there is a God, and they called him, <hi>Nomine Deum, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ Spiritum, ordine Motorem primum,</hi> but knew him not. He that ſhall deny there is a God, ſins with a very high hand againſt the light of Nature; for every Creature, yea, the leaſt Gnat and Fly, and the meaneſt worm that crawls upon the ground, will confute and confound that man that diſputes whether there be a God or no. The Name of God is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40825:53"/> in ſuch full, fair, and ſhining Characters upon the whole Creation, that all men may run and read, that there is a God. The Notion of a Deity is ſo ſtrongly and deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſt upon the tables of all mens hearts, that to deny a God, is to quench the very Principles of common Nature; yea, 'tis formally <hi>Deicidium,</hi> a killing of God as much as in the Creature lyes.

I think <hi>Zeno</hi> hit the mark, when he ſaid, to hear and ſee an Atheiſt dye, will more demonſtrate that there is a God, then all the Learned can do by all their Arguments.

That <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> that bragged at a Feaſt, that he did never offer Sacrifice to a God, was eaten up of Lice.

I have read of ſome Heathens, who being at Sea in a very dangerous ſtorm, where they were like to be caſt away, they began every one apart to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves, what ſhould be the reaſon of ſo dreadful a ſtorm; and after that they had all caſt up their acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hath it not been thus with many of you? if it hath, lay your hands upon your mouths, and ſay, the Lord is righteous, though he hath laid your houſes in aſhes. <hi>Anacharſes</hi> uſed to ſay, that the firſt cup of wine was for thirſt, the ſecond for nouriſhment, the third for mirth, and the fourth for madneſs; but what would he have ſaid, had he lived within or without the Walls of <hi>London</hi> theſe laſt ſix years?

Theſe are the men that have kindled a burning upon all thy glory.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40825:56"/>
            <p> O Sirs! that you would for ever remember, that Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Luxury is a ſin, an enemy that</p>
            <p>Firſt, Robs God of his glory, it denies him all ſervice and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> obedience. Intemperate perſons are neither fit for praying to God, nor praiſing of God, nor receiving from God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance turns the Temple of the holy Ghoſt into a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, a Kitchin, a Hog ſtye; and what glory then can God have from an intemperate perſon? But, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It robs both God and man of much precious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> time; time is a precious Jewel, more worth then all the world. One called his friends Thieves, becauſe they ſtole <note place="margin">When <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> heard a clock ſtrike, he would ſay, I have one hour more to anſwer for: ſo precious a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel was time in his eye.</note> time from him: and certainly there are no worſe thieves then Intemperance; for that robs men of their hearing-times, and their praying-times, and their reading-times. There is ſo much precious time ſpent in the Tavern and in the Tipling-houſe, that the intemperate perſon cannot be at leiſure to ſpend any time in his Family or in his Cloſet, &amp;c to ſave his own or others Souls: but there will come a time, either in this or the other world, wherein all intemperate perſons will wiſh that they had ſpent that precious time in ſerving of God, and in ſaving their own and others Souls, which they have ſpent in Luxury and exceſs, carouſing and drinking; but all too late, all too late. Time is not only the fruit of Gods indulgence, but alſo the fruit of Chriſts purchaſe. That Doom paſſed upon <hi>Adam, In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death (or dying, thou ſhalt dye)</hi> had been put in execution immediately, had not Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed immediately between mans ſin and Gods wrath. What can there be of more weight and moment then Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? It is the Heaven of Heaven, and the very Hell of Hell, without which neither would Heaven be ſo deſirable, nor Hell ſo formidable. Now this depends upon time. Time is the Prologue to Eternity; the great weight of Eternity <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 2. Iſa. 49. 8.</note> hangs upon the ſmall wire of time: our time, whether it be longer or ſhorter, is given us by God to provide for our everlaſting condition: we have Souls to ſave, a Hell to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40825:56"/> eſcape, a Heaven to make ſure, our pardon to ſue out, our intereſt in Chriſt to make good; and all this muſt be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, or we undone, and that for ever. Mans eternal weal or wo depends upon his well or ill improvement of that inch of time that is allotted to him. Now what a dreadful account will ſuch give up at laſt, who have waſted away their precious time in Luxury and Exceſs. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Luxury, Intemperance, it robs men of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> names. <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> a beaſtly drunken Emperor, was called a Tankard, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> was ſirnamed <hi>Biberius</hi> for his tipling, and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> called <hi>Eccius Jeccius</hi> for the ſame cauſe, and <hi>Diotimus</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> was called a Tun-diſh, and young <hi>Cicero</hi> a Hogs-head. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Luxury, Intemperance, it robs men of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> health; for how many are there, that by drinking other mens healths, have deſtroyed their own? Many more periſh by Intemperance then by violence. Intemperance is the ſource and nurſe of all diſeaſes; more periſh by ſurfeiting then by ſuffering: every intemperate perſon digs his own grave with his own mouth and teeth, and is certainly a ſelf-tormenter, a ſelf-deſtroyer, a ſelf-murtherer. I have read <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Radulph. Fornerius, ſelect. lib.</hi> 3.</note> of a Monk at <hi>Prague,</hi> who having heard at ſhrift the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of many Drunkards, wondred at it, and for an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment he would needs try his brain with this ſin, ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he ſtole himſelf drunk. Now after the vexation of three days ſickneſs, to all that confeſſed that ſin, he enjoyned no other penance but this, Go and be drunk again; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby, that there was no puniſhment, no torment that could be inflicted upon a Drunkard, ſo great as that, Go and be drunk again. Beſides all other plagues that attend this ſin, drunkenneſs is a wo to it ſelf. Temperance is the beſt and nobleſt Phyſick, and they that uſe it, commonly are moſt long-liv'd. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Intemperance robs men of their Eſtates, it robs the Wife many times of her Dowry, and the Children of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their Portion, and the Husband of his Inheritance, his Trade, his all. The very word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Luxury, properly ſignifies
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40825:57"/> the not preventing or keeping of the good which at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we enjoy. <hi>Solomon</hi> hit the mark, when he ſaid, <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 21.</note> 
               <hi>drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty.</hi> The full cup makes an empty purſe, and a fat diſh makes a lean bag; he that draws thee wine out of the Pipe, puts thy money into his own pocket; and this <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philoſopher well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when he askt of the frugal Citizen but a penny, but begged of the Prodigal a Talent; and being askt the reaſon of his practice, he anſwered, Becauſe of the one he thought he might beg often, but of the other who ſpent ſo faſt, he was like to receive but once. Mr. <hi>Livins,</hi> when he had ſpent a great Eſtate in luxurious living, jeſting at his own folly, he ſaid, that he had left nothing for his Heir more then air and mire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> making War upon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> underſtood that they were a luxurious people, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew his Army, ſaying, it was needleſs to make War upon them, who by their Luxury would ſhortly overthrow themſelves. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Intemperance robs men of everlaſting happineſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and bleſſedneſs; it ſhuts them out from all the glory of that upper world, and tumbles them down to the loweſt Hell, as <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Luke 16. 19. 'to the 26.</note> you may ſee in that great inſtance of luxurious <hi>Dives.</hi> The intemperate mans table proves a ſnare to his Soul; fulneſs breeds forgetfulneſs, wantonneſs blockiſhneſs and ſtupidity; and therefore no wonder, if God ſhuts the gates of glory againſt intemperate perſons. Look as no Leper might be in <note place="margin">Numb. 5. Judg. 12. Chap 7. Deut. 23.</note> the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and as no <hi>Gileadite</hi> might paſs over <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and as no fearful man might enter into the wars of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and as no baſtard might enter into the Sanctuary: So no luxurious perſon ſhall enter into Heaven. Of all ſorts of ſinners, the luxurious ſinner is moſt rarely reformed; the Adulterer may become chaſt, the Thief may become an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, the Swearer may obtain a ſanctified tongue: But how rare is it to ſee a luxurious perſon repent, break off his ſins, cloſe with Chriſt, and walk to Heaven? Luxurious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <note place="margin">Math. 21. 31, 32. Luke 23. 43.</note> eat and drink away their Chriſt; yea, they eat and drink away their Souls, nay, they eat and drink away their own Salvation. They that ſerve their own bellies, ſerve not the <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 10.</note>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40825:57"/> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore they ſhall never raign with him in the other world. Certainly that man that makes <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> his belly his God, ſhall be for ever ſeparated from God. All Belly-gods ſhall at laſt be found in the belly of Hell: the intemperate perſon hath his Heaven here, his Hell is to come. Now he has his ſweet cups, his merry cups, his pleaſant cups: O, but there is a cup of ſhame and ſorrow, and this ſhall be their portion for ever and ever! The intemperate perſon <note place="margin">Pſal. 11. 6.</note> hath been a gulf to devour many mercies, and therefore he ſhall at laſt be caſt into a gulf of endleſs miſeries. In a word, Intemperance is another ſin, a breeding ſin, 'tis a ſin that is an inlet to all other ſins; we may well call it <hi>Gad,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 17. 24. Jer. 5. 7, 8, 9.</note> a Troop cometh. O the pride, the oppreſſion, the cruelty, the ſecurity, the uncleanneſs, the filthineſs, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs that comes trooping after Intemperance! And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concludes, that double puniſhments are due to Drunkards; firſt for their drunkenneſs, and then for other ſins committed in and by their drunkenneſs. Now ſeeing that Intemperance and Luxury is ſo great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſin, is it any wonder to ſee divine Juſtice turn the moſt glorious Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world into a ruinous heap, when this ſin of Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is rampant in the midſt of them? Ah, <hi>London! Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don!</hi> the Intemperance and Luxury that has been within and without thy Walls, has brought the deſolating Judgment of Fire upon thee, that has laid all thy glory in aſhes and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.

And how have many men been forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man themſelves, either to pleaſe ſome, or to avoid the anger

               </gap>e againſt it. I have been the longer upon this Head, becauſe Luxury, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance is one of the great Darling-ſins of our Age and day, 'tis grown to Epidemical, not only in the City, but in the Countries alſo, and 'tis a very God-diſhonouring, and a God-provoking, and a Soul-damning, and a Land-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin: and, O that what I have writ, might be ſo bleſt, as to put ſome effectual ſtop to thoſe notorious publick Exceſſes and Luxuries that have been, and ſtill are rampant in moſt Parts of the Land.</p>
            <p>But now, Beloved, this ſin of Luxury and Intemperance I cannot charge with clear and full evidence upon the people of the Lord, that did truly fear him, and ſincerely ſerve him, whoſe habitations were once within or without the Walls of <hi>London;</hi> nay, this I know, that for this very ſin among others, their Souls did often mourn before the Lord in ſecret. And truly of ſuch Chriſtians that live and wallow in Luxury and Intemperance, if we compare their lives and Chriſts Laws to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I think we may confidently conclude, <hi>Aut haec non eſt Lex Chriſti, aut nos non ſumus Chriſtiani,</hi> Either this is not Chriſtianity, or we are not Chriſtians.

And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> preferred brute beaſts before luxurious perſons; for they go from belly to labour, when the luxurious perſon goes from belly to bed, or from belly to Cards or Dice; if not, to ſomething that is worſe.

            <p>So Bribery is a ſin that brings deſolating and deſtroying Judgments both upon Perſons and Places. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 10, 11. <hi>For as much therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat; ye have built houſes of hewen ſtones, but ye ſhall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleaſant vineyards, but ye ſhall not drink wine of them; for I know your manifold tranſgreſſions and your mighty ſins: they afflict the juſt, they take a bribe, and they turn aſide the poor in the gate from their right.</hi> Bribery is one of thoſe mighty ſins, or one of thoſe bony or big-boned ſins, as the Hebrew hath it; for which God threatens to turn them out of houſe and home. Bribery is a bony ſin, a huge ſin, a hainous ſin, a monſtrous ſin, a ſin that is capable of all manner of aggravations; and therefore the Lord puniſheth it with deſolating Judgments. <hi>Job</hi> 15. 34. <hi>And fire ſhall conſume the tabernacles of bribery (or the receivers of gifts,</hi> as both the Hebrew and the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint may be read.) When wicked men build their houſes, their Tabernacles by pilling and polling, by bribery, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, defrauding, or over-reaching others, 'tis a righteous thing with God to ſet their houſes on fire about their ears. Thus <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had his houſe wholly conſumed by Lightning and a flame of fire that fell from Heaven upon it, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells <note place="margin">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40825:67"/> Feaſt. Marriage-feaſts that are uſually made by Kings, are full of joy, and full of ſtate, full of ſplendor and glory; who can ſum up the variety of diſhes and dainties that then the Gueſts are feaſted with? The variety of the glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, favours, and mercies of Chriſt that are diſcovered and tendered by God in Goſpel-offers, in Goſpel-ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is the Wedding-feaſt to which all ſorts of ſinners are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; but here you ſee they ſlight, and ſcorn, and contemn both Maſter of the feaſt, and the matter of the feaſt, and all thoſe ſervants that were ſent to invite them to the feaſt; and hereupon the King was wroth, and ſent forth his armies (the <hi>Romans,</hi> as moſt Interpreters do agree) and deſtroyed thoſe murderers, and burnt up their City.

The ſtrongeſt and the ſweeteſt wine always makes the ſharpeſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar; the freeſt, the richeſt, and the choiceſt offers of mercy, if ſlighted and contemned, turn into the greateſt fury and ſeverity. Divine wrath ſmoaks and burns againſt none ſo fiercely, as it doth againſt thoſe who are deſpiſers of Goſpel-mercies. When gold is offered, men care not how great or how baſe he is that offers it: neither is it material by whom the Goſpel is brought unto us, whether it be brought unto us by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as ſome think, a Prophet of the blood Royal, or by <hi>Amos</hi> from amongſt the Herdmen of <hi>Tekoa.</hi> Let the hand be more noble or more mean that brings it, if it be ſlighted and contemned, provoked Juſtice will revenge it. Such as ſlight the Goſpel, and contemn the Goſpel, they ſin with a high hand againſt the remedy, againſt the means of their recovery. This is the condemnation, this is that <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 19.</note> deſperate ſin that haſtens Judgments upon Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as <hi>Jury, Aſia, Bohemia,</hi> and other parts of the world have ſadly experienced.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40825:69"/> paſt all help and hope. Sins againſt the Goſpel are ſins of a greater ſize, of a louder cry, and of a deeper dye, then ſins againſt the Law are, and accordingly God ſuits his Judgments. Where the Goſpel ſhines in power, it will either mend a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or mar a people: it will either better them, or worſen them; it will either fit them for the greateſt good, or it will bring upon them the greateſt evils: Where it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, there it will deſtroy. And this <hi>London</hi> hath found by woful experience. Slighting and contemning of the offers of grace in the Goſpel, is a ſin that is not chargeable upon the greateſt part of the world, who lyeth in wickedneſs, and who ſit in darkneſs, and in the region and ſhadow of death; yea, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 19. Math. 4. 16.</note> 'tis a ſin that is not chargeable upon the Devils themſelves, and therefore the more ſeverely will God deal with thoſe that are guilty of it. The Goſpel hath for above this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſhined forth out of the dark and thick clouds of Popery and Antichriſtianiſm which had over-ſpread the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in no part of the Land hath the Goſpel been preached with more clearneſs, ſpiritualneſs, life, power, and purity then in <hi>London.</hi> And Oh that I had not cauſe to ſay, that there was no part of the Nation where the Goſpel was more undervalued, ſlighted, and contemned by many then in <hi>London!</hi> For,</p>

Now were there none within nor without thy Walls, O <hi>London,</hi> that did ſlight and contemn the Miniſtrations of the Goſpel, the Ordinances of the Goſpel? When old <hi>Barzillai</hi> had loſt his taſte and hearing, he cared not for <hi>Davids</hi> Feaſts and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. There were many within and without the Walls of <hi>London</hi> that had loſt their ſpiritual taſte and hearing, and ſo cared not for Goſpel-miniſtrations, for Goſpel-ordinances. There were many, who under a pretence of living above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, lived below Ordinances, and made light of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yea, who ſcorned, vilified, and contemned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinances of Chriſt. <hi>Thou art to them as a lovely ſong,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31, 32.</note> ſaith the Prophet: in the Hebrew it runs thus, <hi>Thou art to them as one that breaks jeſts.</hi> The Solemnity and Majeſty of the Word was but as a dry jeſt unto them; Ordinances were but as dry jeſts to many within and without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore no wonder if God hath been in ſuch good earneſt with them who have made but a jeſt of thoſe precious Ordinances, that are more worth then Heaven and Earth. Many came to the Ordinances too much like the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Dog, which laps a little as he runs by the ſide of <hi>Nilus,</hi> but ſtays not to drink. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Such as are weary of the Goſpel, ſuch ſlight the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Goſpel, ſuch contemn the Goſpel. Never were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> more weary of Manna, then many within and without the <note place="margin">Numb. 11. 6.

            <p>Fourthly, Such as have but a low and mean opinion of the Goſpel, ſuch are ſlighters and contemners of the Goſpel; ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as prefer every toy, and trifle, and faſhion, and ſinful cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23.</note> and baſe luſt above the light of the Goſpel, the power of the Goſpel, the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ſweetneſs of the Goſpel, ſuch are ſlighters and contemners of the Goſpel. Though it be better to preſent truth in her native plainneſs, then to hang her ears with counterfeit Pearls; yet there were many that ſet a greater price upon the arts, the parts, the gifts, the ſtudied notions and Seraphical expreſſions of their Miniſters, then they did upon the Goſpel it ſelf: and what was this but to prefer the Handmaid before the Miſtreſs, the Servant before his Lord, the flowers about the diſh before the meat that was in the diſh, the chaff before the Wheat, and Pebbles before the richeſt Pearls? The Goſpel is the field, and Chriſt is the Treaſure that is hid in that field; the Goſpel is a Ring of gold, and Chriſt is the Pearl in that Ring of gold: and yet how many were there within and without the Walls of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that put no conſiderable price or value upon the Goſpel? But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Such as wilfully diſobey the Goſpel, and live and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> walk in ways quite croſs and contrary to the Goſpel, ſuch are ſlighters and contemners of the Goſpel, and accordingly the Lord will deal with them: Take one Text for all, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. <hi>And to you who are troubled reſt with us when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40825:70"/> 
               <hi>know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus. Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> This is a more terrible Text againſt all ſuch as are either ignorant of the Goſpel, or that diſobey the Goſpel, then any is to be found in all the Old Teſtament. In the laſt day Chriſt will take vengeance in flaming fire on them that diſobey his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that walk contrary to the Rules of his Goſpel; and therefore no wonder, if before that day he lays their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſolate by a flaming fire, whoſe lives give the lye to his glorious Goſpel. Theſe men above all others, expoſe the Goſpel to the deriſion and contempt of the baſeſt and vileſt men. When ſome of the Heathens have lookt upon the looſe lives of Profeſſors, they have ſaid, <hi>Aut hoc non eſt Evangelium, aut hi non ſunt Chriſtiani,</hi> Either this is not the Goſpel, in which there is ſo much goodneſs, or theſe are not Chriſtians, in whom there is none at all. Did you never hear nor read of one, who eying the looſe converſations of Profeſſors, cryed out, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Philoſophis,</hi> Let my Soul be rather with the honeſt Philoſophers (who were Heathen) then with theſe wicked lewd men that are called Chriſtians? Now were there none within nor without the Walls of <hi>London</hi> that did wilfully diſobey the Goſpel, and that walkt in ways quite croſs and contrary to the Goſpel? ſurely there were, and therefore at their doors we may ſafely lay the burning of <hi>London.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Such as ſlighted, ſcorned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the faithful, ſincere, ſerious, gracious, and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Profeſſors of the Goſpel, ſuch ſlighted, ſcorned, and contemned the Goſpel it ſelf. When the Jews were in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſeph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 8</note> it was the manner of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to repute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their neareſt Couſins.

When Profeſſion was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40825:71"/> in faſhion, and Religion was in credit, how many were there within and without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> that did pretend to be kin, to be Couſins to the ſerious, conſcientious, and ſincere Profeſſors of the Goſpel, who ſince the day of their affliction, have not only denied all acquaintance with them, and renounced all relation to them, but alſo are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlighters, ſcorners, and contemners of them? if theſe may not be reckoned among the ſlighters, ſcorners, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Goſpel, I do not know who may. To ſum up all, I have ſhewed you that ſlighting, ſcorning, and contemning of the Goſpel, is a ſin of that high nature, that it provokes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Lord to lay Cities deſolate. I have ſhewed you the greatneſs of that ſin, and the perſons that are guilty of it; ſo that now you may point with a finger to thoſe perſons that have laid <hi>London</hi> in aſhes.</p>
            <p>But before I cloſe up this Particular, give me leave to ſay, That this ſin of ſlighting, ſcorning, and contemning of the Goſpel, I dare not charge upon thoſe that truly fear the Lord, and that have found the Goſpel to be a Goſpel of power upon their own Souls, turning them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to Jeſus Chriſt. And I <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 5, 6, 7. Acts 26. 18.</note> ſhall freely give you my Reaſons, that you may be the better ſatisfied, that 'twas not ſo much their ſins as your own, that has brought down that heavy Judgment of Fire upon the City, wherein once you and they had your reſpective habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. My Reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thoſe that did truly fear the Lord, and that had experienced the power of the Goſpel in a ſaving way upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> their own Souls, they did frequently before the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail and mourn over (both together and apart) that hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4. 6.</note> ſin of ſlighting, ſcorning, and contemning of the Goſpel which many were guilty of, whoſe habitations were then ſome within, and others without the Walls of <hi>London.</hi> The Jews have a Law which enjoyns them to take up any paper which they ſee lying on the ground, and the reaſon is, leſt happily the Name of God be written in the paper, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40825:71"/> trodden under foot. Though Chriſtians ought to be free from ſuch ſuperſtitious curioſities; yet they ought to be very careful, that the leaſt tittle of the Goſpel, the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Goſpel be not trod under foot. Now the Saints who once lived within and without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> who through grace have experienced the ſaving power of the Goſpel upon their own Souls, how have they mourned and lamented to ſee that glorious Goſpel of Chriſt trod under foot, which they have layen ſo near their hearts! and therefore I cannot fairly charge this ſin upon them. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Slighting, ſcorning, and contemning of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Goſpel, is a great ſtep towards the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and a ſin of ſo great a cry, and ſo deep a dye, that I cannot <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3. Chap. 10. 28, 29.</note> at preſent find where 'tis in Scripture charged upon ſuch as truly fear the Lord, and that have really experienced the power of the Goſpel in a ſaving way upon their own Souls; and therefore I cannot fairly charge this ſin upon them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Next to God, the Goſpel is the moſt ſweet and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> delightful thing in all the world to gracious Souls, who have experienced the ſaving power of it upon themſelves. <hi>Luth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Dolphins, they ſay, love Muſick, and ſo do gracious Souls love the Muſick of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The Goſpel is like the ſtone <hi>Garamantides,</hi> that hath drops of gold within it ſelf, enriching all that will embrace it, and conform to it: and this the Saints have found by experience, and therefore they cannot but delight in it, and draw ſweetneſs from it. <hi>Aglutuidas</hi> never reliſhed any diſh better then what was diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, There are none that do ſo highly prize the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Goſpel, and that ſet ſo high a value upon the Goſpel, as thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40825:72"/> do who have experienced the ſaving power of the Goſpel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Souls; ſuch prefer the Goſpel before all their neareſt and deareſt concernments and enjoyments that they <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 11. Rev. 2. 12, 13. Heb. 11. 33, 38. <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſaith, that the ſhorteſt line and the leaſt letter thereof is more then all Heaven and Earth. <hi>Tertul. Apol. cap.</hi> 5.</note> have in this world: As might be made evident from their practice in the primitive times, and in the <hi>Marian</hi> days, and in thoſe late years that are now paſt over our heads. The Tabernacle was covered over with red (and the purple Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tell us, they take that habit for the ſame intent) to note, that we muſt defend the truth of the Goſpel, even to the effuſion of blood: and this they have made good in all the Ages of the World, who have found the ſaving power of the Goſpel upon their own Souls. <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes, that the Goſpel muſt needs be a precious thing, becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> hated it; and indeed it was ſo precious to the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his days, that they very willingly and chearfully laid down their lives for the Goſpel ſake. Now the ſame Spirit reſts upon the Saints in our days, and therefore upon this ground I cannot charge that horrid ſin of ſlighting, ſcorning, and contemning of the Goſpel upon them. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had three Crowns (as the <hi>Talmud</hi> obſerves) 1. of the King, 2. of the Prieſt, 3. of the Law; but the Crown of the Law, that was the chief of the three.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Who were ſo ready and free to countenance the Goſpel, and to maintain the Goſpel, and to encourage the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> faithful and painful Preachers of the Goſpel, as thoſe that had found the ſweet of the Goſpel, and the ſaving power of the Goſpel upon their own Souls. They like well of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without expence in <hi>Baſil,</hi> and a Goſpel without charge in <hi>Nazianzene;</hi> but if it grow coſtly, 'tis no commodity for their money. Now this was the very frame and temper of many thouſands in <hi>London,</hi> who never experienced the ſaving work of the Goſpel upon their poor Souls: but they were of another frame and temper of ſpirit in <hi>London,</hi> upon whom the Goſpel was fallen in power; and therefore I may not charge upon them this odious ſin of ſlighting, ſcorning, and contemning the Goſpel. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Who were there within or without the Walls of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40825:72"/> 
               <hi>London,</hi> that were ſo much in a hearty and ſerious bleſſing, praiſing, and admiring of the Lord and his goodneſs, for bringing them forth in Goſpel-times, as thoſe that had a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of the Goſpel upon their own Souls? When <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was born, his Father <hi>Philip</hi> bleſſed ſuch Gods as he had, not ſo much that he had a Son, as that he had him in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> days: he was thankful for natural and moraldiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. The cleareſt, the choiceſt, the fulleſt, and the ſweeteſt viſions and diſcoveries that we have of God on this ſide Eternity, we have in the Goſpel, and this they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, who have found the Goſpel falling in power upon their Souls; and therefore they cannot but always have Harps in their hands, and Hallelujahs in their mouths <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 1, 2. 3, 4. Chap. 19. 1. to verſ. 8.</note> upon this very account, that they have lived under the warm Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel; and therefore I ſhall not charge this vile ſin of ſlighting, ſcorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, and contemning the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel upon them who above all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her men were moſt exerciſed in a ſerious and hearty bleſſing and praiſing of God for his glorious Goſpel. Some there were that bleſt God for their yearly incomes; and others there were that bleſt God for their proſperous relations and friends: and many there were that bleſt God for their deliverance from various perils and dangers. But thoſe that had the Goſpel working in power upon them, they made it their buſineſs and work above all to bleſs the Lord for the Goſpel; and therefore who dare charge upon them the contempt of the Goſpel? But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, There were none within nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> that have ſuffered ſo many things, and ſuch hard things for the enjoyment of the Goſpel in its power and purity, as they have done who have found the powerful and ſaving work of the Goſpel upon their own Souls: ſuch have been as ſigns and wonders in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Now what folly and vanity would it be to charge <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 18.</note> them with ſlighting, ſcorning, and contemning of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who have been the only ſufferers for the Goſpel ſake. And thus much for the twelfth ſin that brings the fiery Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation upon Cities and People.</p>

A lye is a voluntary and wilful telling of an untruth, with a purpoſe to deceive; ſo that three things are required to the nature of a lye. 1. There muſt be an untruth and falſeneſs in the thing. 2. This untruth muſt be known to be ſo, he muſt be conſcious to himſelf that it is falſe. 3. He muſt have an intent and purpoſe to utter this falſhood with a deſire or deſign to deceive another by it. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes eight ſorts of Lyes; but the School-men reduce all to three. 1. Is <hi>joco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> the ſporting Lye. 2. Is <hi>officioſum,</hi> the helpful Lye. 3. Is <hi>pernicioſum,</hi> the pernicious and hurtful Lye.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is <hi>mendacium jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſum,</hi> the ſporting Lye; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this is when men will lye and tell untruths to make men ſport, to make men merry. Of this ſin the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> complains, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>They make the King glad with their wickedneſs, and the Princes with their lyes.</hi> Courtiers frame <note place="margin">It is a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinion in theſe days, that, <hi>Qui ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcit diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, neſcit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</hi>
               </note> fictions, and tell ridiculous ſtories to delight Princes. Among many Courtiers loud lyes are eſteemed ornaments and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of ſpeech; and none are accounted ſoſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in their diſcourſe, as thoſe that can tell the moſt pleaſing lyes: but ſuch Mirth-mongers and Mirth-makers may do well to remember, that ſuch kind of mirth will bring bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the end. If for every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, <note place="margin">Math. 12. 36. Phil. 5. 4.</note> they muſt give an account in the day of Judgment, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much more for every lying word. And if fooliſh talking and jeſting be condemned, then ſurely lying talking, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40825:74"/> jeſting ſhall be much more condemned, if not here, yet in the great day, when all lying Jeſters ſhall hold up their hands at Chriſts Bar. Now were there none within nor without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> that were guilty of merry lyes, of ſporting lyes? But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is <hi>mendacium officioſum,</hi> the officious lye, the helpful lye; and that is when a man lyes to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or others at a pinch, at a dead lift. When men lye either <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 15. to the 20. Joſh. 2. 1. to verſ. 9. 1 Kings 13. 14. to 27.</note> to prevent ſome danger they fear, or elſe to bring about ſome good they deſire, then they tell an officious lye. Thus the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Midwives lyed, and thus <hi>Rahab</hi> lyed, and thus the old Prophet lyed, who contrary to the command of God, perſwaded the man of God to go back and eat bread with him under the pretence of a divine Revelation. And thus <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Jacob</hi> told his father an officious (threefold) lye, but he hardly ever had a merry day, a good day after it; for God followed him with variety of troubles, and his ſorrows, like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, came poſting in one after another, even to his dying day, that both himſelf and others might ſee what bitterneſs is wrapt up in officious lyes. <hi>Solon</hi> reproving <hi>Theſpis</hi> (the Poet) for lying, <hi>Theſpis</hi> anſwered him, that it was not material, ſeeing it was but in ſport; then <hi>Salon</hi> beating the ground with his ſtaff, ſaid, If we commend lying in ſport, we ſhall find it afterwards in good earneſt. In all our bargains and dealings, let us make it our wiſdom and our work to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>That we muſt not do evil, that good may come;</hi> yea, we <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> muſt not tell a lye to ſave all the Souls under Heaven. The <hi>Priſciallaniſts</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> (a moſt peſtilentious Sect) taught in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, That it was lawful to lye for the helping of a good cauſe, and for the propagating of the Goſpel, and for the advantage of Religion. But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conſuted them, and ſtoutly aſſerts in two Books, That we are not to tell an officious lye, to tell a lye for no hurt, but for good, though it were to ſave all the world. <hi>Will ye ſpeak wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> to his <note place="margin">Job 13. 7.</note> friends? A man may as well commit fornication with the <hi>Moabites</hi> to draw them to our Religion, or ſteal from the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40825:74"/> rich to give to the poor, as lye to do another man a good turn. <hi>Nepos</hi> reporteth of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> a noble man of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and a famous Warriour, that he would never lye in jeſt nor in earneſt, either for his own or anothers gain. This refined Heathen will one day riſe in Judgment againſt ſuch kind of Chriſtians, who take a great pleaſure in officious lyes. Now were there none within nor without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> that delighted themſelves in officious lyes? But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and to come cloſer to our work) There is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>mendacium pernicioſum,</hi> the pernicious and hurtful Lye; and <note place="margin">Gen. 39. 13. to the 20. 2 Kings 5. 22, 23.</note> this of all lyes is the worſt. When men will lye out of a deſign to hurt, to cheat, to defraud, or to make a prey of thoſe they deal with: this is the foreſt of all lyes. Now how rampant was this ſort of Lying among all ſorts of Citizens before <hi>London</hi> was in flames? What a common trade of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did many (I ſay not all) drive in their buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? The trade of lying was got into every Trade, as if there had been no living but by lying? Many Sellers had their lyes to ſet off their Commodities: it is good, it is very good, it's ſpecial good, it's the beſt of its kind; when 'twas naught, very naught, yea, ſtark naught: of this ſort there are none ſo good in the City, when their conſciences told them, that they had much better in their own Shops; that their Commodity coſt them ſo much, and that they could not abate, nor would not abate any thing of that price they had pitcht, though it were to their own father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet rather then they would loſe a good Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they preſently agree at a lower price. And ſo when poor Workmen came to their Shops, and offered their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to ſell, being forced thereunto for the relief of themſelves and their miſerable families, they ſlighted their Commodities, telling them, that they had no need of them, and that they had much of thoſe Commodities upon their hands already, and that they had no way to vend them; and all to beat down the price, and to make a prey of their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſity; and all this when they wanted thoſe very Commodities, and had more vend for them then they knew
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40825:75"/> how to ſupply. Now as the Seller abounded with his lyes, ſo the Buyer had his lyes too; and all to bring down the price: it's naught, it's naught, it's very naught, ſaith the Buyer. I will not give you your price, and yet gives it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes out of the Shop or Ware-houſe. I have bought as good, yea, better for a lower price then what I offer you (ſaith the Buyer) when yet he had never bought of that Commodity before. Uſe me well (ſaith the Buyer) and you ſhall have my cuſtom another time, when in his heart he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves never to come into the Sellers Shop more. Ah, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don! London!</hi> 'tis theſe Lyes and Lyars that have made thee deſolate, and that have laid thy glory in the duſt. O Sirs! a man were better be a loſer then a lyar, a man were better, much better, to keep his Commodity, then to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l his Conſcience with his Commodity. We hate the <hi>Turks</hi> for ſelling of Chriſtians for Slaves; and what ſhall we then think of thoſe Citizens, who by lying ſell themſelves and their precious Souls for half a Crown, yea, oftentimes for a Penny? I have read that there was a time when the <hi>Romans</hi> did wear Jewels on their ſhoes: but Lyars do worſe; for they trample that matchleſs Jewel, <hi>viz.</hi> their precious Souls under feet. Doubtleſs the lyes that were told in <hi>London,</hi> and the Lyars that lived in <hi>London,</hi> did more then a little help on the ruine of <hi>London.</hi> Now that you may the better read and underſtand the Righteouſneſs of God in his higheſt acts of ſeverity againſt Lyes and Lyars, premiſe with me briefly theſe four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That lying is a very great ſin, 'tis a tranſgreſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not of one, but of many of the Royal Laws of Heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Ye ſhall not lye one to another.</hi> Zacha. 8. 16. <hi>Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour.</hi> Eph. 4. 25. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for we are members one of another.</hi> In the body of man one member will not lye to another; the hand will not lye, in telling what it toucheth; the tongue will not lye, in telling what it taſteth; the eye will not lye, in telling what it ſeeth: but every member is a true witneſs to another, a

Every one ſhould ſpeak the truth with his neighbour: One member in the natural body will not mock another, nor make a fool of another; and why then ſhould one Chriſtian by lying mock another, or make a fool of another? <hi>Tremellius</hi> tranſlates it thus: <hi>Ne fatuum agito,</hi> Do not play the fool with him.

'Tis a dangerou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What God commands muſt be put in ſpeedy execution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out denying, or delaying, or diſputing the difficulties that attend it. The great God will not endure to be called to an account by the poor Creature concerning his Royal Commands; but expects that with all readineſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> we ſhould obey what he requires, even when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our obedience is hid from our eyes; for then grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Holy Ghoſt in the Hebrew tongue calleth a Lye <hi>Aven,</hi> which alſo ſignifieth Iniquity; implying that all lyes are iniquity, and that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> iniquity is after a ſort included in a lye, which doth ſufficiently evidence, that lying is no ſmall ſin. I might further argue thus, That which is contrary to God, who is the choiceſt and the chiefeſt good; yea, who is goodneſs and truth it ſelf, that muſt needs be the greateſt evil: but lying is contrary to the Nature, Eſſence, and Being of God, witneſs the deſcription that he gives of himſelf both in the Old and New Teſtament. <hi>And the Lord paſſed by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and</hi>

But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider this, that pernicious Lyes and Lyars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:40825:76"/> are very deſtructive to all humane Societies, Kingdoms, and Common-wealths. Lying deſtroys all Society, all Commerce, and Converſe among the Sons of men. Man (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher obſerveth) is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſociable Creature. Speech is the means whereby men have ſociety and commerce one with another. Now lying perverts that order which the God of truth hath appointed to be among the Sons of men. 'Tis the will and pleaſure of God, that the Sons of men converſing together, ſhould by their words and ſpeeches and diſcourſes impart and communicate their minds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, intentions, and meanings one to another, for the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good of one another, and for the profit and benefit of the whole. Now if there be nothing in mens words, but lying, deceit, and fraud inſtead of truth, what can follow but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and deſolation? When the language of men was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, ſo that one could not tell what another ſpake, then preſently followed the diſſolution of their combination; for the Lord ſcattered them abroad from thence, upon the face of all the Earth, and they left off to build the City: when <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 7, 8.</note> one asked brick (ſaith a <hi>Rabbin)</hi> another brought clay, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>R. Sal.</hi> The Hebrew Doctors ſay, that at this diſperſion there were ſeventy Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſundry languages. Gen. 49. 6. Pſal. 120. 2. Jer. 9. 1. to the 6.</note> then they fell together by the ears, and one daſhed out the others brains; and by thls means their communion was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and God brought on them the evil which they ſought to prevent, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. But ſurely a lying tongue is a far worſe enemy to Society then an unknown tongue: and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is for a man to have no ſociety at all, then with ſuch as he cannot believe what they ſay; or if he do, he ſhall be ſure to be deceived by them. Concerning ſuch, we may well take up the words of <hi>Jacob: O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret, unto their aſſembly; mine honour, be not thou uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> And pray with <hi>David: Deliver my ſoul, O Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. Jeremiah</hi> did ſo loath and abominate the ſociety of Lyars, that he had rather live in a Wilderneſs, then live among them, or have any thing to do with them. Lyars deſtroy that Communion and Society that by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations they ought to preſerve and maintain. Lying diſſolves that mutual truſt that we ſhould have with one another; for hereby all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40825:77"/> Covenants, and Intercourſe of dealings between man <note place="margin">Mendax hoc lucratur, ut cum vera di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit, ei non credatur.</note> and man, which is (as it were) the life of the Kingdom or Common-wealth, are quite overthrown. When men make no conſcience of lying, nor of keeping their word any further then either fear of loſs, or force of Law compelleth them, all Civil communion is at an end. There can be no truſt where there is no truth, nor no Commerce with thoſe that cannot be truſted. The <hi>Scythians</hi> had a Law, that if any man did <hi>(duo peccata contorquere)</hi> bind two ſins together, a lye and an oath, he was to loſe his head, becauſe this was the way to take away all faith and truth among men. Had this Law been put in execution in <hi>London,</hi> I have reaſon enough to fear that many Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>izens would have loſt their heads long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had loſt their houſes by the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te dreadful Fire. Now ſeeing that pernicious lying, a courſe, a trade of lying, is ſo deſtructive to humane Society, why ſhould we wonder to ſee the Lord appear in flaming fire againſt it? But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider, that lying is a ſin that is moſt odiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and hateful to God; yea, a ſin that makes men odious and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hateful to him. Lying is repugnant unto God; for God is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one that cannot lye. He is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the God of <note place="margin">Titus 1. 2. Iſa. 65. 16.</note> truth, and therefore lying cannot but be odious to him. God is ſaid not only to forbid a lye, but to hate a lye. A lye, 'tis an ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mination. Now we abominate that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our natures. Amongſt thoſe things that are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord, a lying tongue is reckoned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 17. <hi>Theſe ſix things doth the Lord hate, yea, ſeven are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to him. A proud look, a lying tongue,</hi> or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew runs, <hi>a tongue of lying,</hi> that is, a tongue that hath learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the trade, and can do it artificially; a tongue that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to lying, a tongue that is delighted in lying. So Verſe 19. <hi>A falſe witneſs that ſpeaketh lyes, and him that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſcord among brethren.</hi> Among theſe ſeven things abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by God, lying is twice repeated, to note how great an abomination lying is in the eye and account of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord;</hi> not only offenſive or odious, but abominable. Lyars pervert the end
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40825:77"/> for which God created ſpeech, which was to give light to the notions of the mind, and therefore the Lord loaths them, and plagues them in this life with great ſeverity, as you may ſee in thoſe ſad inſtances of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> whoſe lye was puniſhed <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. 20. to the end. Acts 5. 5. to the 11.

What ſhall be given unto thee? or what ſhall be done unto thee, thou falſe tongue? ſharp arrows of the Mighty</hi> (God will retaliate ſharp for ſharp) <hi>with coals of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper.</hi> The coals of Juniper burn hot, and laſt long (ſome ſay, a month and more) and ſmell ſweet. Now upon theſe coals will God broil lying lips, and a deceitful tongue, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf and others in the execution of his wrath upon a lying tongue, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>A falſe witneſs ſhall not be unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and he that ſpeaketh lyes ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Though men ſometimes by lying may eſcape the diſpleaſure of men; yet they ſhall never by lying eſcape the wrath and diſpleaſure of God. Wrath is for that man, and that man is for wrath, who hath taught his tongue the trade of lying, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Ephraim daily increaſeth lyes and deſolation.</hi> Deſolation is the fruit and conſequent of lying; ſin and puniſhment are inſeparable companions: they who heap up lyes, haſten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40825:78"/> both upon themſelves and the places where they live. Now if lying be a ſin ſo hateful and odious to God, no wonder, if God appears in flaming fire againſt it. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Lying is a ſin againſt the Light and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Law of Nature, it is a ſin againſt natural Conſcience; and therefore 'tis that a little child will bluſh many times when he tells a lye. It was obſerved of <hi>Pomponius Atticus, Ciceroes</hi> great Friend, that he never uſed lying, neither could he with patience lend his ear to a Lyar. <hi>Tennes</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (who was worſhipped as a God) was ſo ſtrict in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he cauſed an Ax to be held over the witneſſes head to execute them out of hand, if they were taken with fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhood or a lye. Among the <hi>Scythians,</hi> when their Prieſts foretold an untruth, they were carried along upon hurdles full of heath and dry wood drawn by oxen, and manacled hand and foot, and burnt to death. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, by the <note place="margin">

For (ſaith he) we have tongues given us to expreſs our minds and meanings one to another by. Now if our tongues tell more or leſs then our minds conceive, it is againſt Nature. It is ſaid of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> a Heathen, that he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>mendacium jocoſum</hi> a jefting lye. <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls Lying a Tinkerly ſin, a ſin that is both hateful and ſhameful. <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes</hi> ſaith, that he is unhappy, who rather uſeth lyes, though ſeemingly good, then truths when he judgeth them evil. To think the truth, ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> is honeſt, but a filthy and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thing to lye. I could (ſaith my Author) both ſigh and ſmile at the ſimplicity of ſome Pagan people in <hi>America,</hi> who having told a lye, uſed to let their tongues blood in expiation thereof. A good cure for the Squinancy, but no ſatisfaction for lying. Theſe Heathens will one day riſe in Judgment againſt ſuch amongſt us as make no conſcience of lying. To bring things cloſe; thoſe that lived within and without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> that were given up to a trade, a courſe of lying, thoſe perſons ſinned with a high hand, not only againſt the Light of Nature, but alſo againſt as clear, as glorious a

               </gap>all ſeriouſly dwell upon theſe four things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That lying is a very great ſin. 2. That Lyes and Lyars are very deſtructive to all humane Societies, Kingdoms, and Common-wealths. 3. That Lying is a ſin moſt hateful and odious to God. 4. That Lying is a ſin againſt the Light and Law of Nature; he will ſee cauſe enough to juſtifie the Lord in that late dreadful Fire that has thus been amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But before I cloſe up this Particular, give me leave to ſay, That this trade, this courſe of Lying that brings that ſore Judgment of Fire upon Cities and Countries, I cannot charge with any clear evidence upon thoſe that did truly fear the Lord, whoſe habitations were once within or without the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> before it was turned into a ruinous heap; and that upon theſe grounds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe a trade, a courſe of Lying is not conſiſtent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with the truth or ſtate of Grace. A trade, a courſe of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I know <hi>Jacob</hi> lyed, and <hi>David</hi> lyed, and <hi>Peter</hi> lyed; but none of theſe were ever given up to a trade of lying, to a courſe of lying. The beſt Saints have had their extravagant motions, and have ſadly miſcarried as to particular actions: but he <note place="margin">

               </gap>cquits. We muſt always diſtinguiſh between ſome ſingle evil actions and a ſerious courſe of evil actions. It is not this or that particular evil action, but a continued courſe of evil actions that denominates a man wicked. As it is not this or that particular good act, but a continued courſe of holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that denominates a man holy. Every man is as his courſe is; if his courſe be holy, the man is holy; if his courſe be wicked, the man is wicked. There is a Maxime in Logick, <hi>viz.</hi> That no general Rule can be eſtabliſhed upon a particular Inſtance. And there is another Maxime in Logick, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40825:79"/> no particular Inſtance can overthrow a general Rule. So here, look as no man can ſafely and groundedly conclude from no better premiſes then from ſome few particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (though in themſelves materially and ſubſtantially good) that this or that mans ſpiritual eſtate is good; ſo on the other hand, no man ought to conclude becauſe of ſome particular ſinful actions and extravagant motions, that this or that mans ſpiritual eſtate is bad. A trade of Lying can never ſtand with a trade of Holineſs, a courſe of Lying can never ſtand with a courſe of Godlineſs. Though the Needle of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Compaſs may jog this way and that way; yet the bent of the Needle will ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll be Northward: So though a <hi>Jacob,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Peter</hi> may have their particular ſinful joggings this way or that way; yet the bent of their hearts will ſtill be God-wards, Chriſt-wards, Heaven-wards, and Holineſs-wards. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as did truly fear the Lord within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> ſuch did in their ſolemn Addreſſes to the Lord, both together and apart, lament and bewail that trade, that courſe of lying that was predominant among many that day; and therefore I dare not charge the trade, the courſe of lying upon their ſcores. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A lye draws its Pedigree from the Devil, and ſuch as make a trade of lying, ſuch are certainly Satans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> children, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Ye are of your father the devil, and the</hi>

            <p>The eighth ſin that brings the Judgment of Fire, is mens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, <hi>Jude</hi> 7. <hi>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> In theſe words there are theſe three things obſervable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The places puniſhed, and they are <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and the Cities about them, which were <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim. Egeſippus,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> ſay, that ten Cities were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 23. Hoſ. 11. 8.</note> and ſome ſay, thirteen Cities were deſtroyed when <hi>Sodom</hi> was deſtroyed: but theſe things I ſhall not impoſe upon you as Articles of Faith. The overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them was total, both in reſpect of the Inhabitants, and the places themſelves; their ſin was univerſal, and their puniſhment was as univerſal. That pride, idleneſs, and fulneſs of bread that is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> did uſher in thoſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 49, 50.</note> wickedneſſes that laid all waſte and deſolate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſins that brought theſe puniſhments, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>The giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh:</hi> The firſt is, <hi>Giving themſelves over to fornication,</hi> Now the word <hi>[Fornication]</hi> is not to be taken properly and ſtrictly for that act of uncleanneſs that is often committed between perſons unmarried; but it is here to be taken for all ſorts of carnal uncleanneſs. The Heathen thought fornication no vice, and therefore they made it a common cuſtom, and were wont to pray thus: <hi>The Gods increaſe the number of the</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:40825:81"/> 
               <hi>Harlots.</hi> The ſecond ſin that is charged upon them is, <hi>Their going after ſtrange fleſh</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>another fleſh,</hi> as the words in the Original run.) The Apoſtle in this modeſt and covert expreſſion, <hi>Going after ſtrange fleſh, or other fleſh, or another fleſh,</hi> doth hint to us their monſtrous and unlawful luſts that were againſt the Courſe, Light, and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they gave themſelves up to ſuch filthineſs, as is ſcarce to be named among men; they went after other fleſh then what Nature or the God of Nature had appointed. The <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 21. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> great God never appointed that male and male, but only that male and female ſhould be one fleſh; 'tis impoſſible that man and man in that execrable act ſhould make one fleſh, as man and woman do. The fleſh of a male to a male muſt needs be another fleſh. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth their filthineſs thus. <hi>For even their women did change the natural</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>uſe into that which is againſt nature; and likewiſe alſo the men leaving the natural uſe of the women, burned in their luſt one toward another: men with men, working that which is unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Chryſoſtom</hi> well obſerves on theſe words, that whereas by Gods Ordinance in lawful copulation by Marriage, two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one fleſh, both Sexes were joyned together in one; by <hi>Sodomitical</hi> uncleanneſs the ſame fleſh is divided into two, men with men working uncleanneſs as with women of one Sex, making (as it were) two. The Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es had left the God of Nature, and therefore the Lord in his juſt Judgment left them to leave the order of Nature, and ſo to caſt ſcorn and comtempt upon the whole humane Nature.</p>
            <p>Again, There is another ſort of pollution by ſtrange fleſh, <note place="margin">Levit. 18. 23.</note> and that is a carnal joyning of a man with a beaſt, which is prohibited: <hi>Neither ſhalt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u lye with any beaſt.</hi> Oh, what a ſink of ſin is in the nature of man, the heart of man! And as this pollution is prohibited, ſo 'tis puniſhed with death. <hi>And</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 20. 15.</note> 
               <hi>if a man lye with a beaſt, he ſhall ſurely be put to death, and ye ſhall ſlay the beaſt.</hi> The Lord, to ſhew the horridneſs and the hainouſneſs of this beaſtly ſin, commands that even the poor, harmleſs, innocent beaſt (that is neither capable of ſin, nor of provoking or enticing man to ſin) muſt be put to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40825:82"/> death. Oh, how great is that pollution that pollutes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beaſts, and that makes the unclean more unclean, and that doth debaſe the beaſt below a beaſt! Now to this ſort of pollution the beaſtly <hi>Sodomites</hi> had without doubt given up themſelves.</p>
            <p>The third thing obſervable in the words, is the ſeverity of their puniſhment, <hi>Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> commonly ſay, that fire and water have no mercy, and we have frequently experienced the truth of that ſaying. When God would give the world a proof of his greateſt ſeverity againſt notorious ſinners and notorious ſins, he doth it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the Judgment of Fire; when the <hi>Sodomites</hi> burned in their luſts one towards another, <hi>Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimſtone and fire, from the Lord out of heaven. The Lord rained brimſtone and fire from the Lord,</hi> (that is) by an elegant Hebraiſm, from himſelf; it being uſual with the Hebrews to put the Noun for the Pronoun, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the Margine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27. 1 Sam. 15. 22. 2 Chron. 7. 2. 1 Kings 8. 1.</note> Now this fiery vengeance came not from any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior cauſe, but from the ſupream cauſe, even God himſelf. This brimſtone and material fire that was rained by the Lord out of Heaven, was not by any ordinary courſe of Nature, but by the immediate almighty power of God. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was the ſupernatural and miraculous work of the Lord, and not from any natural cauſe, that ſuch ſhowers, not of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as when the Old world was drowned; but of material fire and brimſtone, ſhould fall from Heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> (to which add <hi>Adama</hi> and <hi>Zeboim;</hi> for all theſe four Cities were burnt together) God rained, not ſprinkled, yea, he rained not fire only, but fire and brimſtone for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their torment, and that they might have a Hell above ground, a Hell on this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de Hell. They had hot fire for their burning luſts, and ſtinking brimſtone for their ſtinking bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs. They burned with vile and unnatural luſts, and therefore againſt the courſe of Nature fire falls down from Heaven, and devours them, and their ſtinking abominable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lthineſs is puniſhed with the ſtench of brimſtone mingled with fire. Thus God delights to ſuit mens puniſhments to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40825:82"/> their ſins; yea, that temporal fire that God rained out of Heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> was but a fore-runner of their everlaſting puniſhment in that Lake which burns with <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> fire and brimſtone for evermore. The temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the impenitent <hi>Sodomites,</hi> did but make way to their <note place="margin">Jude 7.</note> eternal puniſhments, as <hi>Jude</hi> tells us. I readily grant, that the fire of Hell was typified by that fire which fell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> but I cannot conceive, that the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> in the place laſt-cited, doth intend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to prove that the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were deſtroyed by Hell-fire; for in the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis</hi> (to which the Apoſtle alludes) there is no mention at all of Hell-fire or of Eternal fire; and doubtleſs the example that ſhould warn ſinners to repent of their ſins, and to turn to the moſt High, is to be taken from the Hiſtory in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> I cannot at preſent ſee how <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> can be ſet forth as an example to ſinners by ſuffering the puniſhment of Hell-fire, when the Hiſtory is wholly ſilent as to any ſuch fire. Some to mollifie the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing auſterity of that Phraſe which <hi>Jude</hi> u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal fire, read the words thus: <hi>Were made an example of eternal fire, ſuffering vengeance;</hi> by which conſtruction they gather, that the fire which hath irreparably deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> was a type and figure of that fire of Hell, of that Eternal fire that is reſerved for wicked men, and by which ſinners ought to be warned. Others by eternal fire under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the duration of the effects of the firſt temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſoil thereabout wearing the marks of divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to this very day. Several Authors write, that the Air there is ſo infectious, that no creature can live there; <note place="margin">Joſephus, Tertullian, Auguſtine, &amp;c.</note> and though the Apples and other fruit that grow there ſeem pleaſant unto the eye; yet if you do but touch them, they preſently turn into cinders and aſhes. The ſtinking Lake of <hi>Aſphaltes</hi> near to <hi>Sodom,</hi> is left as a perpetual Monument of Gods Vengeance, killing all fiſh that ſwimmeth in it, and fowls that flye over it. Others by eternal fire underſtand an utter deſtruction, according to that 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow</hi> (that is, utterly deſtroyed them) <hi>making</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40825:83"/> 
               <hi>them an enſample unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly.</hi> God hangs them up in Gibbets, as it were, that others might hear and fear, and not dare to do wickedly as they had done.</p>
            <p>What though it be ſaid, that the fire wherewith theſe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi> were deſtroyed was eternal; yet there is no neceſſity to underſtand it of Hell-fire: for even that very fire which conſumed thoſe Cities may be called Eternal, becauſe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that was inflicted on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> by fire, was a puniſhment that ſhould laſt as long as the world laſted. God reſolved thoſe Cities ſhould never be rebuilt, but remain perpetual deſolations in all generations. Now in this ſenſe the word <hi>[Eternal]</hi> is often uſed in the Scripture. Again the fire and brimſtone that fell upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> was a type and figure of that eternal fire or thoſe eternal torments that ſhall be inflicted upon all impenitent ſinners for ever and ever. The ſum of all is this, that the <hi>Sodomites</hi> by giving themſelves over to fornication, and by going after ſtrange fleſh, did provoke the Lord to rain Hell out of Heaven upon them: they did provoke the Lord to rain material fire and brimſtone both upon their perſons and their habitations. Now give me leave to ſay, that doubtleſs the body of the inhabitants of that famous City which is now laid in aſhaes, were as free from giving themſelves over to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, as any in any part of the Nation; yea, more free then many in ſome parrs of the Nation: yea, give me leave to ſay, that I cannot ſee how theſe ſins that are charged upon the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> can be clearly or groundedly charged upon any of the precious Servants of the Lord, that did truly fear him in that renowned City: And my Reaſons are theſe,</p>

By the Laws of thoſe two Emperors, <hi>Theodiſius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius, Sodomites</hi> were adjudged to the fire. In the Councel of <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Templers who were found guilty of this ſin, were decreed to be burnt. And among the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was lawful for him who was attempted to that abuſe to kill him who made the aſſault. <hi>Tertullian</hi> brings in Chriſtianity triumphing over Paganiſm, becauſe this ſin was peculiar to Heathens, and that Chriſtians never changed the Sex, nor accompanied with any but their own wives.

And the <hi>Julian</hi> Law among the <hi>Romans</hi> puniſhed Adultery with death, by cutting off the heads of thoſe that were guilty of that fact.

I have read of ſome Heathens that have puniſhed this ſin with a moſt ſhameful death, and the death was this; they would have the Adulterers or Adultereſſes head to be put into the paunch of a beaſt, where lay all the filth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs of it, and there to be ſtif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, Theſe expreſſions of giving themſelves over to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, implies,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Their making conſtant proviſions for their baſe luſts. O the time, the pains, the coſt, the charge that ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               </note> are at to make proviſion for their unſatiable luſts!</p>
            <p>Secondly, It implies an exceſſive violent ſpending of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtrength beyond all meaſure and bounds in all laſciviouſneſs and <hi>Sodomitical</hi> uncleanneſs. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells of <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, It implies their impudency and ſhameleſneſs in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their filthineſs and uncleanneſs; they had a Whores fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; they proclaimed their laſciviouſneſs before all the <note place="margin">Jer. 3. 3. Chap. 6. 15. Iſa. 3. 10. Gen. 13. 13.</note> world; they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh: hence 'tis, that the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> are ſaid to be ſinners before the Lord; that is, they ſinned openly, publickly, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, without any regard to the eye of God at all. <hi>Bring</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 5.</note> 
               <hi>them out to us, that we may know them.</hi> O faces hatcht with impudency! they ſhrowd not their ſins in a mantle of ſecrecy, but proclaim their filthineſs before all the world, they had out-ſinn'd all ſhame; and therefore they gloried in their ſhame: they were ſo arrogant and impudent in ſinning, that they proclaimed their filthineſs upon the houſe-top. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It implies their reſolvedneſs and obſtinacy in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſinning in the face of all the terrible Warnings and Alarms that God had formerly given them by a bloody War, and by <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 10, 11, 12.</note> the ſpoiling and plundering of their Cities, and by taking away of their victuals (fulneſs of bread was a part of their ſin, and now cleanneſs of teeth is made a piece of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in Gods juſt Judgment) and by <hi>Lots</hi> admonition <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 11.</note> and mild oppoſition. It is obſervable, that when they were ſmitten with blindneſs, they wearied themſelves to find the door. God ſmote them with blindneſs, both of body and mind; and yet they continued groaping to find the door, being highly reſolved upon buggery and beaſtiality, though they dyed for it. O the hideous wickedneſs and prodigious madneſs of theſe <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that when divine Juſtice had ſtruck them blind, their hearts ſhould be ſo deſperately ſet upon their luſts, as to weary themſelves to find the door! But what will not Satans bond-ſlaves and fire-brands of Hell do? Sottiſh and beſotted ſinners will never tremble when <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> God ſtrikes. But,</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40825:85"/>
            <p> Fifthly, Theſe expreſſions of giving themſelves over to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, implies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 32.</note> pleaſure, content, and ſatisfaction that they took in thoſe abominable practices. <hi>They have choſen their own ways, and their ſouls delight in their abominations. They had</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 3. 2 Theſ. 2. 12. 2 Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs. Luther</hi> tells us of a certain Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee in his Country, that was ſo beſotted with the ſin of Whoredom, that he was not aſhamed to ſay, that if he might ever live here, and be carried from one Whore-houſe to another, there to ſatisfie his luſts, he would never deſire any other Heaven. This filthy Grandee did afterwards breathe out his wretched Soul betwixt two notorious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots. All the pleaſure and Heaven that theſe filthy <hi>Sodomites</hi> look after, was to ſatisfie their brutiſh luſts. Hark, Scholar (ſaid the Harlot to <hi>Apulcius)</hi> it is but a bitter-ſweet that you are ſo ſond of; and this the <hi>Sodomites</hi> found true at the long run, when God ſhowred down fire and brimſtone upon them. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Theſe words of giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, implies their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> great ſetled ſecurity in thoſe brutiſh practices. The Old world was not more ſecure when God ſwept them away <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> with a Flood, then the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were ſecure when God <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 14.</note> rained fire and btimſtone out of Heaven upon them. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> could not kill <hi>Argus</hi> till he had caſt him into a ſleep, and with an inchanted Rod cloſed his eyes: No more could the Devil have hurt theſe <hi>Sodomites,</hi> if he had not firſt lull'd them aſleep in the bed of ſecurity. Carnal ſecurity opens the door for all impiety to enter into the Soul. <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he had in vain aſſaulted a City, and could not take it by force, deviſed this Stratagem in way of agreement, he told them he would leave the Siege, and make Peace with them, upon condition that they would let in a few weak, ſick, and wounded Souldiers among them to be cured. They let in the Souldiers, and when the City was ſecure, the Souldiers let in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Army. A carnal ſetled ſecurity will let in a whole Army of luſts into the Soul; and this was the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> caſe. To ſum up all, thoſe expreſſions in <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 7.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40825:85"/> of giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, do imply or take in theſe ſix things laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which things will not ſtand with the truth of Grace or ſtate of Grace; and therefore thoſe ſins that are ſpecified by <hi>Jude</hi> cannot be charged with any clear, fair, or full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the people of God, who did truly fear him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or without the Walls of <hi>London.</hi> But ſhould this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe fall into any of their hands, who have given themſelves over to fornication, or to go after ſtrange fleſh, then I would ſay, that it very highly concerns all ſuch perſons to lay their hands upon their loyns, and to ſay, we are the very men, the ſinners, the monſters that have turned a rich and populous City into a ruinous heap. But,</p>
            <p>The ninth ſin that brings the ſore Judgment of Fire upon a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> People, is prophanation of the Sabbath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>ult. But if you will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath-day, and not bear a burden, even entring in at the gates of Jeruſalem on the Sabbath-day, then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall devour the palaces of Jeruſalem, and it ſhall not be quenched.</hi> In this memorable Scripture you may obſerve. 1. A ſpecification of the Judgment that God will puniſh Prophaners of his Sabbath with, and that is fire. 2. The ſpecification of the object that this fire ſhall fall upon, <hi>viz.</hi> a City, not a Town, a Village, or any other mean place, but a City, a ſtately City, a populous City, a trading City, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure City. 3.

                  </gap>. There dwelt men of Tyre alſo therein, which brought fiſh, and all manner of ware, and ſold on the ſabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jeruſalem. Then I contended with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Judah, and ſaid unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and prophane the ſabbath-day? Did not your fathers thus? and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael by prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſabbath.</hi> Now this is obſervable, that as they had prophaned the Sabbath, ſo <hi>Nebuzaradon</hi> ſet their Temple on fire, and their Noble mens houſes on fire, and all the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mens houſes in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on fire on their Sabbath day I know <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, it was on the tenth day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 13. which ſeveral of the Learned thus reconcile, <hi>viz.</hi> That on the ſeventh day, which was their Sabbath, <hi>Nebuzaradon</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fire in their habitations, and burnt them all quite down on the tenth. Now <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the Text gives theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Gods ſeverity againſt them for prophaning his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.

            <p>Firſt, That God hath fenced this Command more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> about then he has any other, and all to prevent our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it, and the more effectually to ingage us to the keeping of it holy.

            <p>Firſt, It is marked with a <hi>Memento</hi> above all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>Remember the ſabbath-day to keep it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and that partly, becauſe we are ſo deſperately apt and prone to forget it; and partly, becauſe none can keep it holy when it comes, that do not remember it before it comes; and partly, becauſe this is one of the greateſt (if not abſolutely the greateſt) of all the Commandments: it is ſometimes put for all the Ten; it is the Synopſis of them all: and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> ſaith, that the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is a famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to all kind of vertue and piety.</note> the obſervation of all the Commandments depends chiefly upon the obſervation of this fourth. None walk ſo much after the Spirit on other days, as they who are moſt in the Spirit on the Lords day. There are none that walk ſo cloſe with God all the ſix days, as thoſe that keep cloſeſt to God on the ſeventh day. In the due obſervation of this Command, obedience to all the reſt is compriſed; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40825:87"/> becauſe this Command has leaſt light of Nature to direct us to the obſervation of it; and partly, becauſe the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Duty, and prophaning of this Day, is one of the greateſt ſins that a people can be guilty of: it is a violation of all the Decalogue at once: it is a ſin againſt all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments and Commandments of God at once. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is delivered both negatively and affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which no other Command is, to ſhew how ſtrongly it binds us to a holy obſervation of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It hath more Reaſons to enforce it, then any other Precept, <hi>viz.</hi> its equity, Gods bounty, his own Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the Days benediction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is put in the Cloſe of the firſt, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the Second Table, to note, that the obſervation of both Tables depends much upon the ſanctification of this Day.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is very conſiderable alſo, that this Command is more frequently repeated, then others of the Commands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> are, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 35. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19 3. <hi>Levit.</hi> 28. 30.

            <p>Secondly, Conſider that God is highly pleaſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with the ſanctification of his Sabbaths, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17 24, 25.

The ſecond bleſſing that

For on that day <hi>Prague</hi> was loſt; the Sabbaths were wofully prophaned amongſt them: their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility thought it was for their not trimming and beautifying of their Churches; but better and wiſer men concluded, it was for their prophaning of the Lords day. Some are of opinion, that the Flood began on the Lords day, from that <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. they being grown notorious prophaners of the Sabbath. The Council of <hi>Matiſcon</hi> in <hi>France</hi> attributed the irruption of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> to their prophanation of the Sabbath. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider there are ſingular bleſſings which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſanctifying of the Sabbath will crown us with, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Moreover alſo I gave them my ſabbaths to be a ſign between me and them, that they may know that I am the Lord that ſanctifie them.</hi> The ſingular bleſſings that the right ſanctifying of the Sabbath will bring upon us, are, 1. Spiritual; they that conſcientiouſly ſanctifie the Sabbath, they ſhall ſee and know the work of God, the work of Grace upon their own Souls. There are many precious Chriſtians that have a work of God, a work of Grace upon their own Souls, who would give ten thouſand worlds (were there ſo many in their hands to give) to ſee that work, to know that work. Oh, but now they that ſanctifie the Sabbath, they ſhall both ſee and know the work of God upon their own Souls. And they ſhall find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Lord carrying on the work of Grace and Holineſs in their Souls; they ſhall find the Lord deſtroying their ſins, and filling their hearts with joy, and with a bleſſed aſſurance of his favour and love, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 6, 7. <hi>Alſo the ſons of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that joyn themſelves to the Lord to ſerve him, and to love the Name of the Lord, to be his ſervants. Every one that keepeth the ſabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold on my Covenant.</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:40825:88"/> 
               <hi>Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in my houſe of prayer: their burnt offerings and their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſhall be accepted upon my Altar; for mine houſe ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an houſe of prayer for all people.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the ſabbath, from doing thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on my holy day, and call the ſabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words: then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord.</hi> Now in the ſecond place, the other bleſſings that the right ſanctifying of the Sabbath will inveſt us with, are temporal bleſſings; for ſo they follow in the Scripture laſt cited. <hi>And I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,</hi> here is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſteem, and ſafety; <hi>and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father.</hi> Now the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 13. And Chap. 48. 4.</note> which God promiſed to <hi>Jacob.</hi> Hereby is noted that comfortable proviſion that God would make for them that ſanctified his Sabbaths: Such as make the Sabbath their delight, they ſhall never want protection nor proviſion, God will be a Wall of fire about them, and a <hi>Canaan</hi> to them. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider that our Lord Jeſus, who is the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of the Sabbath, and whom the Law it ſelf commands us to <note place="margin">Math. 12. 8. Deut. 18. 18, 19.</note> hear, did alter it from the ſeventh day to the firſt day of the week, which we now keep: For the holy Evangeliſts note, that our Lord came into the midſt of the Aſſembly on the two firſt days of the two weeks immediately following his Reſurrection, and then bleſſed the Church, breathing on them the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19-26. <hi>Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut where the diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you. And after eight days, again his diſciples were within, and Thomas with them, then came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut, and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid, Peace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e unto you.</hi> Look as Chriſt was forty days inſtructing <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Sinai,</hi> what he ſhould teach, and how he ſhould govern the Church under the Law: ſo he continued forty days teaching
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40825:89"/> his Diſciples what they ſhoult preach, and how they ſhould govern the Church under the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghoſt had given commandments unto the Apoſtles whom he had choſen. To whom alſo he ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion by many infallible proofs, being ſeen of them forty days, and ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, but that within thoſe forty days he likewiſe ordained, on what day they ſhould likewiſe keep the Sabbath; and 'tis obſervable, that on this firſt day of the week, he ſent down from Heaven the Holy Ghoſt upon his Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1-4. <hi>And when the day of the Pentecoſt was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the ſpirit gave them utterance.</hi> So that on that day they firſt began, and ever after continued the publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry. Chriſt who was Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 28. had a ſoveraign right to change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it to what day he pleaſed. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conſider that according to the Lords mind and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Commandment, and the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, the Apoſtles in all the Chriſtian Churches ordained, that they ſhould keep the holy Sabbath upon the firſt day of the week, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. <hi>Now concerning the collection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Galatia. Even ſo do ye upon the firſt day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him, that there be no gathering when I come.</hi> In which words you may obſerve theſe five things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Apoſtles ordained this day to be kept holy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefore 'tis of a Divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the day is named the firſt day of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> week, therefore not the Jewiſh ſeventh, or any other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Every firſt day of the week, which ſheweth its <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> perpetuity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it was ordained in the Churches of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as well as of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and he ſetled one uniform in all
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40825:89"/> the Churches of the Saints, therefore it was univerſal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. <hi>For God is not the Author of confuſion, but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That there ſhould be collections for the poor on that day, after the other Ordinances were ended. Now why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſhould the Apoſtles require collections to be made on the firſt day of the week? but becauſe on that day of the week the Saints aſſembled themſelves together in the Apoſtles time. And in the ſame Epiſtle he proteſteth, that he delivered them no other Ordinance or Doctrine, but what he had received from the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 37. <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a Prophet, or ſpiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you, are the Commandments of the Lord.</hi> Now mark, he wrote to them, and ordained among them to keep their Sabbath on the firſt day of the week; therefore to keep the Sabbath on that day, is the very Commandment of the Lord. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Conſider, the Apoſtles on that day ordinarily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> diſpenſed the holy Ordinances, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19-26. <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 7. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued his ſpeech until midnight,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Conſider, ſuch things as are named the Lords in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Scripture, are ever of the Lords inſtitution. <hi>As the Word of the Lord,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3. <hi>The Cup of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 27. <hi>The Supper of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 20. <hi>And ſo the Lords Day,</hi> Rev. 1. 10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</hi> Now why does <hi>John</hi> call it the Lords day? but becauſe it was a day known to be generally kept holy, to the honour of the Lord Jeſus (who roſe from death to life upon that day) throughout all the Churches which the Apoſtles had planted, which St. <hi>John</hi> calls the Lords day, that he might the better ſtir up Chriſtians to a thankful remembrance of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40825:90"/> by Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead. But,</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Conſider, that a right ſanctifying of the Sabbath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> is one of the beſt ſigns in the Bible, that God is our God, and that his ſanctifying work is paſt in power upon us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. <note place="margin">When the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had this queſtion put to them, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſti Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum?</hi> Haſt thou kept the Lords day? anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſtianus ſum, omittere non poſſum,</hi> I am a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, I cannot but keep it.</note> 20. <hi>And hallow my ſabbaths, and they ſhall be a ſign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with God; ſo likewiſe was the Sabbath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31. 13. and becauſe it was a ſign of the Covenant between God and them. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>(Wherefore the Children of Iſrael ſhall keep the ſabbath, to obſerve the ſabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual Covenant.)</hi> God tells them, that they muſt obſerve it for a perpetual Covenant: and hence it was, that when they violated the Sabbath, God accounted it the violation of the Covenant between him and them. The ſanctifying of the Sabbath in the primitive times, was the main Character by which ſincere Chriſtians were differenced from others; they judged of mens ſanctity by their ſanctifying of the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And indeed as there cannot be a greater argument or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a prophane heart then the prophaning the Sabbath: ſo there cannot be a greater argument or evidence of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart then a right ſanctifying of the Sabbath. But,</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Conſider, a right ſanctifying of the Sabbath will <note place="margin">10.</note> be a moſt ſure and certain pledge, pawn, and earneſt of our keeping of an everlaſting Sabbath with God in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt to the people of God,</hi> Gr. <hi>a ſabbatiſm, an eternal reſt, a ſabbath that hath no evening</hi> Now mark, if this Sabbath be a ſign and pledge of Heaven, then we muſt keep it till we come there. For if we loſe the pledge of a benefit, we loſe the evidence of that benefit whereof it is a pledge. A man that is in the Spirit on the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. he is in Heaven on the Lords day: there cannot be a more lively reſemblance of Heaven on this ſide
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40825:90"/> Heaven, then the ſanctifying of the Sabbath in a heavenly manner. What is Heaven, but an eternal Sabbath? And what is a temporal Sabbath, but a ſhort Heaven, a little Heaven on this ſide Heaven? Our delighting to ſanctifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Gods Sabbath on Earth, gives full aſſurance to our faith grounded upon Gods infallible promiſe, that we ſhall enter into Gods eternal Reſt in Heaven; for ſo runs the promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. <hi>ult. Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> The former part of the verſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to earthly bleſſings: but theſe words, <hi>I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father,</hi> that is, with a heavenly inheritance; for what is the heritage of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but <hi>Canaan</hi> in the Type, and Heaven it ſelf in the Antitype? But ſhould I thus ſanctifie the Sabbath, ſhould I be ſure of going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? yes, for ſo it roundly follows in the next words; <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Conſider, that of all days God hath put the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> higheſt honour upon his Sabbaths, by appointing his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ordinances in a ſpecial manner to be uſed on thoſe days. The Sabbath is a gold Ring, and the Ordinances are as ſo many coſtly ſparkling Diamonds in that Ring: All the works of the new Creation are commonly wrought on this day; this is the joyful day wherein ordinarily God gives ſpiritual ſight to the blind, and ſpiritual ears to the deaf, and ſpiritual tongues to the dumb, and ſpiritual feet to the lame. That <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 42. is here applicable. It is a night to be much obſerved to the Lord, for bringing them out from the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> this is that night of the Lord to be obſerved of all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their generation. Thoſe that are new-born, are commonly new-born on this day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a day to be much obſerved to the Lord. Thoſe that are converted, are ordinarily converted on this day; and therefore 'tis that day of the Lord that ought to be obſerved by all the converted <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Thoſe that are edified, are commonly moſt edified on this day. O the ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion!
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40825:91"/> O the choice converſe! O the ſingular diſcoveries! O the bleſſed manifeſtations! O the excellent enjoyments that Chriſt vouchſafes to his people on this day! O the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Grace! O the exerciſe of Grace! O the increaſe of Grace, the progreſs in Grace! O the comforts of Grace that God vouchſafes to his Choſen on this day! Experience ſhews that the right ſanctifying of the Sabbath, is a powerful means under Chriſt to ſanctifie us, and to increaſe our faith, and raiſe our hope, and inflame our love, and to kindle our zeal, and to enlarge our deſires, and to melt our hearts, and to weaken our ſins. But,</p>
            <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, Conſider this, that a right ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> of the Sabbath will croſs Satans grand deſign, it will ſpoil his plot, his maſter-piece. Satan is a deadly enemy to the right ſanctifying of the Sabbath, witneſs the many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations that many Chriſtians are more troubled with on this day, then they are on any other day in the whole week; and witneſs the many vain, wandring, and diſtracting thoughts that many precious Chriſtians are more afflicted with on this day, then they are on all the days of the week beſide; and witneſs that high and hot oppoſition that he in his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note> makes againſt the ſtricteſt obſervers of that day; and witneſs his conſtant prompting and ſpurring ſuch on to the prophanation of the Sabbath, whoſe examples are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and encouraging to wicked men, as Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Parents, and Maſters, &amp;c. and witneſs his ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, conſtant attempts, crafty devices, and deep poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he has made uſe of in all the Ages of the World, to keep people off from a religious obſervation of the Sabbath; yea, and to make them more wicked on that day, then on any other day of the week: May I not ſay then on all other days of the week? I have been the longer upon this ninth Particular, partly becauſe of the weightineſs of it, and partly to encourage the Reader to a more cloſe and ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, and partly to juſtifie thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious obſervers of it, and partly to juſtifie the Lord in turning <hi>London</hi> into aſhes for the horrible prophanation of his day.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:40825:91"/>
            <p> The Sabbath-day is the Queen of days, ſay the Jews. The <note place="margin">The Sabbath-day differs as much from the reſt of the days, as the wax doth to which a Kings Great Seal is put, from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wax.</note> Sabbath-day among the other days, is as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> among Women, ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Look what the Phenix is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Birds, the Lyon among the Beaſts, the Whale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Fiſhes, the Fire among the Elements, the Lilly among the Thorns, the Sun among the Stars, that is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day to all other days; and therefore no wonder, if God burn ſuch out of their habitations, who have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners of his day.

               <note place="margin">Eſth. 7. 8, 9, 10.</note> when he apprehended that he would have put a force upon the Queen? And why then ſhould we wonder to ſee the wrath of the Lord break forth in ſmoak and flames againſt ſuch a generation, that put a force upon his day, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned his day, the Queen of days? Ah Sirs! you have greatly prophaned and abuſed the day of the Lord; and therefore why ſhould any marvel, that the Lord has greatly debaſed you, and laid your glory in duſt and aſhes? In theſe late years, how has prophaneneſs, like a flood, broke in upon us on the Lords day? and therefore it highly concerns all the prophaners of the day of the Lord, to lay their hands upon their hearts, and to ſay, the Lord is righteous, the Lord is righteous, though he has laid our habitations deſolate. Who is ſo great a ſtranger in our Engliſh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as not to know that God was more diſhonoured on the Sabbath-day (within and without the Walls of <hi>London)</hi> then he was in all the other ſix days of the week? and therefore let us not think it ſtrange, that ſuch a fire was kindled on that day, as has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all to aſhes. What Antick habits did men and women

Secondly, I want eyes (at preſent) to ſee how it will ſtand either with the truth of Grace, or ſtate of Grace, for ſuch as are real Saints to live in the open prophanation of Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths. Thirdly, becauſe an ordinary prophaning of the Lords Sabbaths, is as great an Argument of a prophane heart, as any that can be found in the whole Book of God. Fourthly, becauſe Sabbath-days are the Saints Market-days, <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 5. Prov. 17. 16. Iſa. 25. 6. Math. 5. 47.</note> the Saints harveſt-days, the Saints ſummer-days, the Saints ſeed-days, and the Saints feaſting-days; and therefore they will not be ſuch fools as to ſleep away thoſe days, much leſs will they preſume to prophane thoſe days, or to toy and trifle away thoſe days of Grace. Fifthly, what ſingular thing do they more then others, if they are not ſtrict obſervers and conſcientious ſanctifiers of the Lords day. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whatever there was of the hand of man in that dreadful Conflagration, I ſhall not now attempt to divine, but without a peradventure, it was Sabbath-guilt which threw the firſt Ball that turned <hi>London</hi> into flames and aſhes.

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> once Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> was a ſworn Enemy to the Goſpel, &amp; perſecuted the Saints with fire and faggot; and among all his praiſes he reckons, this is the chiefeſt: That he had been a Perſecutor of the <hi>Lutherans, i. e.</hi> the Saints: but what became of him? he was firſt accuſed of Treaſon, and then condemned, and at laſt beheaded.</p>

Oh the dreadful horrors and amazing terrors of conſcience that ſuch have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to! Take a few Inſtances among the many that might be given. The <hi>Vaivod</hi> that had betrayed <hi>Zegeden</hi> a godly man, profeſſed to <hi>Zegedine;</hi> that he was ſo haunted with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> and the Furies of his own Conſcience, that he could not reſt day nor night. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> a cruel Tyrant, a bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note place="margin">Conſcience is Gods Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.

            <p>Ninthly and laſtly, The ſhedding of the blood of the Juſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> is a ſin of ſo high a cry, and ſo deep a dye, that for it God is reſolved (except men repent) that he will ſhut them out <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 21.

            <p>I have read of one <hi>Rabbi Samuel,</hi> who ſix hundred years ſince writ a Tract in form of an Epiſtle to <hi>Rabbi Iſaac</hi> Maſter of the Synagogue of the Jews, wherein he doth excellently diſcuſs the cauſe of their long Captivity and extream mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and after that he had proved, that it was inflicted for ſome grievous ſin, he ſheweth that ſin to be the ſame which <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaks of. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iſrael, and for</hi>

For the firſt, they ſerved four hundred years in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the ſecond, they wandred forty years in the Wilderneſs; for the third, they were Captives ſeventy years in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and for the fourth, they are held in pitiful Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity even till this day.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Phocas,</hi> that bloody Cut-throat, ſought to ſecure himſelf by building high Walls, he heard a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven telling him, That though he built his Bulwarks never ſo high; yet ſin within (blood within) would ſoon undermine all. Shedding the blood of the Juſt, is a ſin that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the ſtrongeſt Bulwarks, and that hath blown up, and burnt up the moſt glorious Cities that have been in the World.

That ſuch are under a high miſtake, that aſcribe the burning of <hi>London,</hi> ſo to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, as that they will allow no more Judgement of God in it, than that which accompanies common caſualty, I ſhall ſufficiently evidence, before I have finiſhed this firſt Uſe. But I hope the prudent Reader will make it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee the ſignal hand of God in this late fiery diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to remember, that the Scribe is more properly ſaid to write, than the Pen; and he that maketh and keepeth the Clock, is more properly ſaid to make it go and ſtrike, than the Wheels and Poizes that hang upon it; and every Workman to effect his work, rather than the tools which he uſeth as inſtruments. So the Lord of Hoſts who is the Chief Agent and Mover in all things, and in all actions, may more fitly and properly be ſaid, to effect and bring to paſs all Judgements, yea, all things that are done in the earth, than any inferiour or ſubordinate cauſes; ſeeing they are but his tools and inſtruments which he rules and guides according to his own Will, Power and Providence. At this ſome of the more civilized Heathen hath long ſince ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame power diſpenſeth both comforts and croſſes, when they painted Fortune in two forms, with two faces of contrary colours, the foremoſt white, the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt black, to ſignifie that both good and evil came from the Goddeſs Fortune. When 'twas told Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> that <hi>delitiae generis humani,</hi> that darling of mankind, <hi>That the ſins of the people cauſed that affliction that was upon him: O no,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have ſins enough of mine own to cauſe that.</hi> So ſhould we all confeſs, that though God take occaſion by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans ſin, or by another mans hand to fire my houſe; Yet the cauſe is juſt that it ſhould be ſo, and that I my ſelf have deſerved it, whatſoever the occaſion, or the inſtrument be. God had matter enough againſt the ſeventy thouſand that died of the Plague, though <hi>Davids</hi> ſin were the occaſion, yet the meritorious cauſe was in them. Certainly there is no man that hath been a ſufferer by this late dreadful Fire, but upon an eaſie ſearch into his own heart and life, he may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40825:103"/> find matter enough to ſilence himſelf, and to ſatisfie himſelf that though God has turn'd him out of his habitation, and burnt up all his comforts round about him, yet he has done him no wrong. Surely in the burning of the City of <hi>London,</hi> there was more of the extraordinary hand of God, than there was of the hand of Papiſt or Atheiſt. God if he had pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could have prevented brutiſh and skilful men to deſtroy <note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 31.</note> and burn, by diſcovering of their helliſh plots before they had taken effect, as he did <hi>Ahitophels,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 10. to the 24. and as he did <hi>Tobiahs</hi> and <hi>Sanballats, Neh.</hi> 4. 7. to <hi>v.</hi> 16.

And God could have directed and ſpirited men to the uſe of the means, and then have given ſuch a bleſſing to the means, as ſhould have been effectual to the quenching of it when it was firſt kindled, but he would not, which is a clear evidence, that he had given from Heaven a commiſſion to the Fire to burn with that force and violence as it did, till all was laid in aſhes.</p>

And this was poor <hi>London's</hi> caſe; for every mans houſe had lain long a Sunning under the ſcorching beams of the Sun, and much brightneſs of weather, which made every thing ſo dry and combuſtible, that ſparks and flakes of fire were ſufficient to ſet mens houſes all in a flame about their ears.

Evil ſhall come upon thee, and thou ſhals not know from whence it riſeth; and miſchief ſhall fall upon thee, thou ſhalt not be able to put it off: and deſolation ſhall come upon thee ſuddenly, which thou ſhalt not know.</hi> Was not <hi>London</hi> the Lady City of our Land? Did the inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> lay thoſe Judgements of God to heart that they either felt or feared? Did <hi>London</hi> remember her latter end? Were not moſt of the inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> given to ſinful pleaſures and delights? Did they not live careleſly and ſecurely? Were they ever ſo ſecure and inapprehenſive of their danger, than at this very time when the flames broke forth in the midſt of them? They had newly eſcaped the moſt ſweeping Plague, that ever was in the City and Suburbs: but inſtead of finding out the plague of their hearts, and mourning over the Plague of their <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 37, 38.

They thought that the worſt was paſt, and that after ſo dreadful a ſtorm they <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 32.</note> ſhould have a bleſſed calm; and dreamed of nothing but peace, and quiet, and ſafety, and Trade; ſtriving with all their might to make up thoſe loſſes, that they had ſuſtained by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40825:105"/> the Peſtilence. They having eſcaped the Grave, when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcore thouſands were carried to their long homes, were very ſecure; they never thought, that the City, which had been ſo lately infected by a contagious Plague, was ſo near <note place="margin">In the Moneth of <hi>Septemb.</hi> the Plague was at the higheſt, and in the ſame Moneth the flames of <hi>London</hi> were at higheſt.

And therefore no wonder if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation came upon them ſuddenly, in a moment, in one day. No marvail that ſo great a Fire was kindled in the very heart of the City, and they not ſee the hand that kindled it, nor have no hands nor hearts to quench it. Judgements are never ſo near, as when men are moſt ſecure, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5. 3. The old world was very ſecure until the very day that <hi>Noah</hi> entered into the Ark. Luke 17. 27. <hi>They did eat, they drank they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entered into the Ark, and the flood came and deſtroyed them all. Luther</hi> obſerveth, that it was in the Spring that the flood came, when every thing was in its prime and pride, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs looked for than a flood: They neither believed, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching, nor his preparations for his own and his childrens ſecurity; but merrily paſſed without intermiſſion, from eating to drinking, and from drinking to marriage till the very day that the flood came and ſwept them all away. Their deſtruction was foretold them to a day, but they were drown'd in ſecurity, and would take no notice of <hi>Noahs</hi> predictions, nor their own peril.

Certainly there are no judgements ſo dreadful and amazing, as thoſe which come moſt ſuddenly and unexpectedly upon the ſons of men: for theſe cut off all hope; they hinder the exerciſe of reaſon; they cloud mens minds; they diſtreſs mens ſpirits; they marr mens councils, and they weaken mens courage; and they daunt mens hearts ſo, that they can neither be ſerviceable to themſelves, nor their friends, not the publick; all this was evidently ſeen upon the body of the Citizens, when <hi>London</hi> was in flames. The more eminent cauſe have we to take notice of the hand of the Lord, in that late fiery diſpenſation that has paſt upon us.

And we may well mourn over the folly and vanity of thoſe men, who were ſo amazed, confounded, diſtracted, beſotted and infatuated (if not worſe) as not to improve all heads, hands, hearts, councils and offers, that were made for the preſervation of the City. This is, and this muſt be for a lamentation, that in the midſt of publick dangers, all ranks and ſorts of men ſhould take more care for the preſervation of their trifling Fardels; (for ſo is any particular mans eſtate, though never ſo great, when compared with the riches of a Rich, Trading, Populous City) than they do for the preſervation of the publick good.

I ſhall not trouble you with the various notions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers concerning the wind, partly becauſe they will do no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the preſent caſe; and partly becauſe our work is to look higher than all natural cauſes. All that either is or can be ſaid of the Wind, I ſuppoſe may be thus ſummed up that it is a creature that may be 1. Felt: 2. Heard: and Little underſtood. Very wonderful is the rice of the Winds; when it is ſo calm and ſtill upon the Seas, that ſcarce a breath of air is perceivable, upon a ſudden the wind is here and there, and every where, Eccleſ. 1. 6. <hi>The wind goeth toward the South, and turneth about unto the North, it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits,</hi> Pſal. 135. 7. <hi>He bringeth the wind out of his treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> But what thoſe treaſuries are, and where they are, no man on earth can certainly tell us. The Wind is one of the great wonders of the Lord, in which, and by which the Lords Name is wonderfully magnified, Pſal. 107. 24, 25. <hi>They that go down to the Sea, ſee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</hi> What wonders? He commandeth and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſtormy wind; although ſome thing may bek nown of this creature in the natural cauſes of it; yet it is a wonder <note place="margin">John 3. 8.</note> above all, that we can know of it. What the Wind is, and from whence it comes, and whither it goes none can tell.</p>
            <p>God is the great Generaliſſimo and Soveraign Commander <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 27. Num. 11. 31. Iſa. 27. 8. Num. 11. 13. Gen. 8. Exod. 1. 10.

Pſal. 147. 18. <hi>He cauſeth his wind to blow.</hi> The winds are at Gods command, to come and go, and go and come at his pleaſure. When there is nothing but a ſweet, ſmooth and ſilver calm on the Seas, if God dos but give forth a word of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40825:109"/> command, how ſoon are they thrown into Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and how dreadfully do the waves daſh and claſh one againſt another? Pſal. 148. 8. <hi>Fire and Hail, Snow and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, ſtormy Wind fulfilling his word.</hi> Sometimes the word that God has to fulfill, is a ſaving word, and ſometimes 'tis a deſtroying word, a drowning word, a ſinking word. Now according to the word that God has to fulfill, ſo do the winds alwayes blow. The Lord hath the winds at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to be his Executioners and adminiſtrators; either of deſtruction or preſervation.

Every wind that blows, has a commiſſion under the Great Seal of Heaven to bare it out in all it dos. If the winds ſhould be examined, queſtioned and required, to give in a full and exact account, of the many thouſand Marriners that they have drowned, and of the many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ships that they have ſpoyled and deſtroyed, and of the many ten thouſand houſes that they have blown down at ſome times, and of the many ſcore thouſand houſes, that (when the fire has been kindled) they have helpt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and reduce to aſhes at other times, they would ſhew you the hand and ſeal of Heaven for all they have done.

But the Lord was angry, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was gone out, that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be burnt, and who could prevent it?</p>
            <p>To cloſe up this particular, conſider much of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Juſtice of God ſhines in the variety of the motions of the wind. Eccleſ. 1. 6. <hi>The wind goeth toward the South, and turneth about unto the North, it whirleth about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</hi> The wind hath its various circuits appointed by God: when the wind blows Southward, Northward, Weſtward, or Eaſtward, it blows according to the Orders that are iſſued out from the Court of Heaven. Sometimes the wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to blow at one point of the Compaſs, and in a ſhort time whirles about to every point of the Compaſs, till it comes again to the ſame point where it blew at the firſt; yet in all this they obſerve their circuits, and run their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, according to the Divine appointment. As the Sun, ſo the winds have their courſes ordered out by the wiſe Providence of God. Divine Wiſdom much ſparkles and ſhines in the circuits of the winds; which the Lord brings out of his treaſure, and makes them ſerviceable, ſometimes to one part of the world, and at other times to other parts of the world. <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 24.

Where is the enemy that has courage or confidence enough to aſſault our City, or to enter into our habitations? but God tells them that they were as barren of good fruit, as the Trees of the Forreſt were barren of good fruit; and therefore he was reſolved by the hand of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>

It bid defiance to all means of reſiſtance; it went on triumphing and ſcorning all humane helps, till it had turned that great and populous City (once counted by ſome the wonder of the world) into a ruinous heap.

O Sirs, 'tis our duty and our high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee the hand of the Lord, and to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the leaſt fires: how much more then does it become us, to ſee the hand of the Lord lifted up in that late dreadful fire that has laid our City deſolate.

At the ſight of this fire, how were the Citizens hearts melted, their hands feeble, their ſpirits faint, and their knees weak! Oh the horror, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the amazement, the confuſion, that had now ſeized up on the ſpirits of all ſorts of Citizens! How were the thoughts of men now diſtracted, their countenances chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their hearts overwhelmed? O the ſad looks, the pale cheeks, the weeping eyes, the ſmiting of breaſts, and the wringing of hands that were now to be ſeen in every Street, and in every corner! What an univerſal conſternation did my eyes behold upon the minds of all men in that day of the Lords wrath! there is no expreſſing of the ſighs, the tears, the fears, the frights and the amazement of the Citizens; who were now compaſſed about with flames of fire! O the cryes, the tumults, the hurries, and the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of one another, that was now in every Street, every one ſtriving with his Pack at his back, to ſecure what he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40825:117"/> could from the rage and fury of the flames. Now one cries out, five pound for a Cart, another cries out, ten pound for a Dray; in one Street one cries out, twenty pound for a Cart, and another in the next Street cries out, thirty pound for a Cart; here one cries out forty pound for a Cart, and there another cries out, fifty pound for a Cart. Many rich men that had time enough to have removed their goods, their wares, their commodities, flattered themſelves, that the fire would not reach their habitations, they thought they ſhould be ſafe and ſecure; but when the flames broke in upon them, O then any money for a Cart, a Coach, a Dray, to ſave ſome of their Richeſt and Choiceſt goods! Oh what fear were many Parents now in, that their Children would either be now trod down in the preſs, or loſt in the crowd, or be deſtroyed by the flames! And what fear were many Husbands now in, concerning their Wives, who were either weak or ſick, or aged, or newly delivered! Words are too weak to expreſs that diſtraction that all men were under, when the fire went on raging and devouring all before it. And this was an evident token to me, that the hand of the Lord was eminent in the fire, and that the Decree was gone forth, that Dear <hi>London</hi> muſt now fall. But,</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Conſider the time that the fire began. It began <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> on the <hi>Lords Day</hi> (being the ſecond of <hi>September)</hi> about one or two of the clock in the morning. Our fears fell upon us on the Lords Day, on that day that ſhould have been a day <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 10. Iſa. 58. 13, 14.</note> of joy and delight unto us. On this day our ſinging was turned into ſighing, our rejoycing into mourning, and all our praiſings into tremblings. O the fears, the frights, the diſtreſſes that men were now under! O the amazed ſpirits, the bedewed checks, the faint hearts, the feeble knees, the weak hands, and the dejected countenances that were now to be ſeen every where! O Sirs, the time when this fatal fire firſt began, was very ominous, it being at a time when moſt Citizens were but newly fallen into a dead ſleep, being wearied out in their ſeveral employments: Several dayes before, but eſpecially on <hi>Saturday</hi> (or the laſt day of the week) that being with very many the moſt bufieſt day in all

Waſting and deſtroying Judgements are ſad any day, but ſaddeſt when they fall on the Lords Day. For how do they diſturb, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and diſtract the thoughts, the minds, the hearts and the ſpirits of men? So that they can neither wait on God, nor wreſtle with God, nor act for God, nor receive from God, in any of the duties or ſervices of his day. And this the poor Citizens found by ſad experience, when <hi>London</hi> was in flames about their ears. Certainly the anger and wrath of God was very high, and very hot, when he made his day of reſt to be a day of labour and diſquiet. When his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould have been a meeting, hearing, reading, praiſing, praying. For the Lord now to ſcatter them, and to deliver them, their ſubſtance and habitations as a prey to the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire; what dos this ſpeak our, but high diſpleaſure? That the fire of Gods wrath, ſhould begin on the day of his reſt and ſolemn Worſhip, is and muſt be for a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſeveral of thoſe Churches where ſome might not preach, there God himſelf preacht to the Pariſhioners in flames of fire. And ſuch who <hi>loved darkneſs rather than light,</hi>

What a terrifying and an amazing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, did God preach to his people of old in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Mount burned with fire? And ſo what terrifying and amazing Sermons did God preach to the Citizens on his own day, when their Temples and their habitations were all in flames. Inſtead of holy reſt, what hurries were there in every ſtreet, yea, in the ſpirits of men? Now inſtead of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40825:118"/> up of Buckets, men in every Street take up arms, fearing a worſe thing than fire. The Jealouſies and Rumors that fire balls were thrown into ſeveral houſes and Churches (by ſuch that had no Engliſh tongues but out-landiſh hands, to make the furious flames flame more furiouſly) were ſo great that many were at a ſtand, and others even at their wits end. Now relations, friends and neighbours haſtened one another out of their houſes, as the Angels haſtened <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 15, 16, 17.</note> Such were the fears, and frights, and ſad apprehenſions that had generally ſeized upon the Citizens.

               </note> an univerſal ſtroke. The ſore ſtrokes of God, which have lately fallen upon the head City <hi>(London)</hi> are doubtleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Heaven, for the puniſhment of the whole body. In the ſufferings of <hi>London,</hi> the whole Land ſuffers. For what City, County, or Town in <hi>England</hi> was there, that was not one way or other, refreſhed and advantaged, if not enriched, with the ſilver ſtreams of <hi>London</hi> that overflowed the Land, as the River <hi>Nilus</hi> doth the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Doubtleſs there are but few in the Land, but are more or leſs concerned in the burning of <hi>London.</hi> There are many thouſands that are highly concerned in their own particulars; there are many thouſands concerned upon the account of their inward friends and acquaintance: and who can number up the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcore thouſands imployed in the Manufacture of the Land, whoſe whole dependance (under God) was upon <hi>London.</hi> What Lamentation, mourning and wo is there in all places of the Land, for the burning of <hi>London,</hi> eſpecially among poor Tradeſmen, Inn-keepers, and others, whoſe livelihoods depended upon the ſafety and proſperity of <hi>London.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is no <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> but one who writes a <hi>Roman hand,</hi> and carries about him a <hi>Romiſh heart,</hi> who feels not, who trembles not under this univerſal blow. Many years labour will not make up the Citizens loſſes to them. Yea, what below the Riches of the <hi>Indies</hi> will effectually make up every mans loſſes to him? He ſhall be an <hi>Apollo</hi> to me, that can juſtly ſumm up the full value of all that have been deſtroyed by thoſe furious flames, that has turned the beſt (if not the richeſt) City in the world, into a ruinous heap. Now their loſs is a loſs to the whole Nation; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40825:119"/> this the Nation already feels, and may yet feel more and more, if God in mercy dos not prevent the things that we have cauſe to fear. 'Tis true <hi>London</hi> is the back that is ſmitten: but what corner is there in all the Land, that hath not more or leſs, one way or another, contributed to the burning of <hi>London.</hi> Not only thoſe that lived in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but alſo thoſe that came up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that Traded with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they even they did by their ſins contribute to <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ruine. They are under a high miſtake, that think it was only the ſins of the City which brought this ſore deſolation upon her: doubtleſs as far as the Judgement extends and reaches, ſo far the ſins extend and reach, which have provoked the Lord, to make poor <hi>London</hi> ſuch an aſtoniſhing example of his juſtice. How are the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cts of <hi>Londons</hi> ruine already felt and ſighed under, all the Nation over. The blood and ſpirits which this whole Nation, hath already loſt by this late lamentable fire, will not be eaſily nor ſuddenly recovered. The burning of <hi>London,</hi> is the Herald of God to the whole Nation, calling it to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation; for the very ſame ſins that have laid <hi>London</hi> in aſhes, are rampant in all parts of the Nation; as you may eaſily perceive, if you pleaſe but to compare that Catalogue that in this Book I put into your hands, with thoſe ſins that are moſt reigning and raging in all places of the Land: by which you may alſo ſee, that they were not the greateſt ſinners in <hi>England,</hi> upon whom the fire of <hi>London</hi> fell; no more than they were the greateſt ſinners in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> upon whom the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell. That the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Luke 13. 4, 5.</note> of <hi>London</hi> is a National Judgement, is evident enough to every man that has but half an eye. But if any ſhould doubt of it, or diſpute it, the Kings Proclamation for a General Faſt on that account, puts it beyond all diſpute. The words of the Proclamation that are proper to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are theſe, <hi>A Viſitation ſo dreadful</hi> (ſpeaking of the burning of <hi>London) that ſcarce any Age or Nation hath ever ſeen or felt the like; wherein although the afflicting hand of God fell more immediately upon the inhabitants of this City, and the parts adjacent; yet all men ought to look upon it, as a Judgement</hi> upon

Now for the want, the lack, the loſs of thoſe Solemn Aſſemblies; ſuch as did truly fear the Lord, were ſolemnly ſorrowfull. Of all loſſes, ſpiritual loſſes are moſt ſadly reſented by gracious ſouls. When they had loſt their houſes, their eſtates, their Trades, their relations, their liberties, and were led captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was an Iron Fornace, a ſecond <hi>Aegypt</hi> to them; then the loſs of their Solemn Aſſemblies, made deeper impreſſions upon their hearts, than all their outward loſſes did. The Jews were famous Artiſts; they ſtand upon record for their skill, eſpecially in Poetry, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks and Muſick: but when their City was burnt, and their Land laid deſolate, and their Solemn Aſſemblies broken in pieces, then they could ſing none of the Songs of <note place="margin">Pſalm 137. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note>

Were there not many tempted to diſtruſt the power of God, the goodneſs of God, the faithfulneſs of God? Were there not many tempted to deny God, to blaſpheme God, and to turn their backs upon God? Were there not many tempted to ſlight the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, to deny the Scriptures, and to prefer their own fancies, notions and delufions above the Scriptures. Were there not many tempted to have low thoughts of Ordinances, and then to leave Ordinances, and then to vilifie Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and all under a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Were there not many tempted, to preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mercies of God; and others tempted to deſpair of the Grace of God?

Were there not many tempted, to have hard thoughts of Chriſt, and others to have low thoughts of Chriſt, and others to have no thoughts of Chriſt. Now for theſe poor tempted ſouls, to have their lives for a prey, and to have precious ſeaſons and opportunities, to recover themſelves out of the ſnares of the Devil, and to arm themſelves againſt all his fiery daris, is a comprehenſive mercy, a big-bellied mercy; a mercy that has many thouſand mercies in the womb of it. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, What a mercy was this, to all ſlumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſlothful, ſluggiſh, lazy Chriſtians, who had blotted and <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> blurred their evidences for Heaven? and who inſtead of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Chriſtian race, were either at a ſtand, or elſe did but <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> halt in the way to Heaven, that they have had their lives for a prey, when <hi>London</hi> was in flames, and that they have had time to clear up their evidences for Heaven, and to quicken <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 32.</note> up their hearts, to run the wayes of Gods commands. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40825:136"/> had all the world been a lump of Gold, and in their hands, to have been diſpoſed of; they would have given it, for a little time, to have brightned their evidences, to have got out of their ſinful ſlumber, and to have ſet all reckonings even between God and their poor ſouls. And let thus much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this ſecond ſupport.</p>
            <p>The third Support to bear up the hearts, and to cheer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> up the Spirits of all that have ſuffered by the late fiery diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that this has been the common lot, the common caſe, both of Saints and ſinners.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bear up ſweetly, bear up chearfully, under your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent trials.

But by the common calamity of the Fire, the Lord has turned you out of houſe and home, and burnt up your ſubſtance before your eyes. Now do but lay your hands ſeriouſly upon your hearts, and tell me, whether you have not more cauſe to admire at the mercy of God towards you in 65. than you have cauſe to complain of the ſeverities of God towards you in 66.</p>
            <p>The fourth Support to bear up the hearts, and to cheer up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the ſpirits of the people of God, who have been ſufferers, deep ſufferers, under the late fiery diſpenſation, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That though they have loſt much, as they are men, as they are Citizens, Merchants, Tradeſmen; yet they have loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as they are Chriſtians, as they are Saints, as they are the called and choſen of God. Though they have loſt their goods, yet they have not loſt their God. Though they <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 14.</note>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:40825:137"/> have loſt their Shops and Cheſts, yet they have not loſt their Chriſt. Though they have loſt their outward comforts, yet they have not loſt the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt.

               </gap> they have loſt their temporal portions, yet they have not loſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note> their eternal portions. Though they have loſt their open Publick Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they have not loſt their Secret Trade, <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 6.</note> their private Trade to Heaven. I readily grant, that your ſtately houſes; and your well furniſht Shops, are turned into aſhes; and that your credit is gone, and your trading gone, and your money gone, and you utterly undone (as to this <note place="margin">Gen 18. 25.</note> world) and yet in all this, God has done you no hurt; he has done you no wrong: and though this at firſt ſight, may ſeem to be a great Paradox, a very ſtrange Aſſertion; yet I ſhall thus evidence it to be an unqueſtionable truth. The happineſs of man in this life conſiſts 1. In his Union with God: 2. In his Communion with God: 3. In his Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God: and Fourthly and laſtly, in his ſpiritual fruition and enjoyment of God. Now none of thoſe loſſes, croſſes, and afflictive diſpenſations that have paſt upon you, have, or can make any breach upon your happineſs, or upon any one of thoſe four things of which your happineſs is made up. The top of mans happineſs in Heaven, lyes in his near un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the more of theſe things any Chriſtian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes in this world, the more of Heaven he enjoyes on this ſide Heaven, the more happineſs he has on this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore I would willingly know, how it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any outward troubles or trya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40825:137"/> Being, then to enjoy him and reſemble him, is our greateſt perfection. If God be the beſt of Beings, then our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, and fruition of him, muſt be our greateſt glory and higheſt felicity. Let what will befall our outward <note place="margin">Omne bonum, in ſummo bono.</note> man, as long as our union and communion with God holds good, as long as our precious and immortal ſouls are in a ſafe and flouriſhing condition; as long as the Springs of Grace, of holineſs, of comfort, of aſſurance, riſes in our ſouls, we are happy, and no outward miſeries can make us miſerable.

Wo, wo, would be to the people of God, if their happineſs ſhould hang upon the comforts of this world, which like a Ball are toſt from man to man; a Ball of fire, a ſtorm at Sea, a falſe Oath, a ſubtle enemy, a treacherous friend, may eaſily deprive a man of all his earthly bleſſings at a clap.

            <p> The Fifth Support to bear up the hearts of the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of God under the late fiery diſpenſation, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord will certainly one way or another make up all their loſſes to them. Sometimes God makes up his peoples outward loſſes, by giving them more of himſelf, more of his Son, more of his Spirit, more of his favour, more of his <note place="margin">John 16.</note> Grace, as he did by the Diſciples of Chriſt. When God takes away your carnals, and gives you more ſpirituals; your temporals, and gives you more eternals; your outward loſſes are made up to you. Now this was the very caſe of thoſe believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were turned out of houſe and home; and who were driven to live in holes and caves, and dens of the earth, and who had loſt all their goods; (not <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> having a Bed to lye on, or a Stool to ſit on, nor a diſh to drink in, and who had loſt all their Apparel, not having a ragg to hang on their backs, and therefore cloathed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins.) <hi>They took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing in themſelves, that they had in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> When under out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">When God takes away Chriſtians eſtates in this world, <hi>Manet altera Coelo,</hi> he looks for a better in Heaven.</note> loſſes, God ſhall ſeal to his people a Bill of Exchange of better and greater things, than any they have loſt; their loſſes then are made up to them. If a man ſhould looſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral baggs of Counters, and have a Bill of Exchange ſealed to him for the receiving of ſo many baggs of Gold; would not his loſs be abundantly made up to him? When God takes away our earthly treaſures, and ſeals up in our hearts a Bill of Exchange, to receive all again with intereſt upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in eternal treaſures, then certainly our loſſes are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made up to us. If men ſhould take away your old cloathes, and give you new; your Raggs, and give you Robes; your Chaff, and give you Wheat, your Water, and give you Wine; your Tinn, and give you Silver; your Braſs, and give you Gold; your Pibble, and give you Pearls, your Cottages, and give you Royal Palaces; certainly you would have no cauſe to complain; you would have no cauſe to cry out undone, undone. If God takes away your houſes, your goods, your Trades, your honors, and gives you more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40825:138"/> of himſelf, and more Grace, and more Aſſurance of Glory, he dos you no injury. It is an excellent change, to get eternals for temporals. If God takes away your earthly riches, and makes you more rich in Grace, in ſpiritual comforts, in holy experiences, in divine employments, then you are no loſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 63<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> than lives, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> runs. If you put many lives toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is more excellency and glory in the leaſt diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of divine love, than in them all. Many a man has been weary of his life; but never was any man yet weary of the love and favour of God. The leaſt drop of Grace, the leaſt <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> ſmile from Heaven, the leaſt caſt of Chriſts countenance, the leaſt kiſs of his mouth, the leaſt embrace of his arm, the leaſt hint of his favour, is more worth than ten thouſand worlds. That Chriſtian cant be poor, that is rich in Grace; nor that Chriſtian can't be miſerable, that has God for his <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 8, 9. Lam. 3. 24. John 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 11. 37, 38. Rev. 2. 17. John 4. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note> portion. That Chriſtian can't be unhappy, who hath a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prepared for him in Heaven; though he hath not a cottage to hide his head in, in this world: nor that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an has no cauſe to complain of want of food for his body, whoſe ſoul is feaſted with Manna, with the dainties of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with thoſe rarities, that are better than Angels food. He that hath but raggs to cover his nakedneſs, if his ſoul be cloathed with the garments of ſalvation, and covered with <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 10.</note> the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, he has no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. When <hi>Stilpo</hi> the Philoſopher, had his Wife, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Countrey, all burnt up before him, and was asked by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> what loſs he had ſuſtained: anſwered, <hi>That he had loſt nothing; for he counted that only his own, which none could take from him; to wit, his virtues.</hi> Shall blind Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do more than Grace? Shall the Heathen put the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to a bluſh?</p>
            <p>Again, Sometimes God makes up his peoples outward loſſes, by giving in greater outward mercies, than thoſe were that he took from them; as you may ſee, by comparing the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40825:139"/> firſt Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and the laſt Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> together; <hi>Job</hi> had all doubled to him. I have read of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> how he <note place="margin">Plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God many times takes away a little, that he may give more: and ſometimes he takes away all, to ſhew his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; and then he gives them all back again with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt upon intereſt, to ſhew his great liberality and noble bounty. That is a lovely loſs, that is made up with ſo great gain.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Did you make conſcience of improving your eſtates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the glory of God, and the good of others, when you did enjoy them; or did you only make them ſubſervient to your luſts?

            <p>Seventhly, Are your hearts under this fiery diſpenſation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> brought into ſuch a quiet ſubmiſſion to the good will and pleaſure of God, as that you can now be contented, to be at <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12, 13, 14.</note> Gods finding, at Gods allowance? Can you now be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be rich or poor, to have much or little, to be high or low, to be ſomething or nothing, to have all again, or to have nothing but neceſſaries again? Are you now willing, that God ſhall chooſe for you? Can you ſit down ſatisfied with Gods allowance, though it be far ſhort of what once you had? Content is the Deputy of outward felicity, and ſupplies the place where its abſent. A contented frame of heart, as to all outward occurrences, is like Ballaſt to a Ship, which will help it to ſail boldly and ſafely in all waters. When a mans mind is conformable to his means, all is well. One brings in God rebuking a diſcontented Chriſtian thus, <hi>What is thy faith? Have I promiſed thee theſe things?

And the moſt proud ſhall ſtumble and fall; and none ſhall raiſe him up: and I will kindle a fire in his Cities; and it ſhall devour all round about him.</hi> There is nothing more fearfull or formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, either to man or beaſt, than fire: and therefore by fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpenſations God will take vengeance on the wicked. This will be the more evident, if you pleaſe but to conſider, to what the wicked are compared in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are compared to ſtubble and chaffe which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fire doth eaſily conſume, Iſa. 5. 24. <hi>Therefore as the fire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth the ſtubble, and the flame conſumeth the chaff: ſo their root ſhall be as rottenneſs, and their bleſſom ſhall go up as duſt.</hi> Nah. 1. 10 <hi>For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they ſhall be devoured as ſtubble fully dry.</hi> Mark that word <hi>fully dry,</hi> and ſo as it were prepared and fitted for the flames.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The wicked are compared to thorns: and how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

God by fiery tryals will keep off from his people more tryals: God loves by the Croſs to ſecure his people from the curſe: and certainly 'tis no bad exchange, to have a croſs inſtead of a curſe.

Oh the moſt dreadful impreſſions, that it makes upon the fleſh. The Schoolmen diſtingiſh thus of fire; they ſay, there is <hi>ignis ardoris, foetoris, &amp; terroris,</hi> fire of heat, of ſtench, and of terror: of heat, as in Mount <hi>Aetna;</hi> of ſtench, as in Mount <hi>Heda;</hi> of terror and fear: as <hi>ignis fulguris,</hi> the fire of lightning in <hi>America:</hi> All theſe fires they ſay are in Hell. But to let the Schoolmen paſs. It is diſputed among many of the learned, Whether there be material fire in Hell or no. That 'tis very probable, that there is material fire in Hell, or that which is full as terrible, or more terrible, may I ſuppoſe, be thus evidenced.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The fire of Hell is frequently mentioned in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scripture. <hi>Who ſhall ſay to his Brother, thou Fool, ſhall be</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>in danger of Hell fire.</hi> At the day of Judgement the tares are <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 22. Chap. 13. 40.</note> burnt in the fire. Into this fire offending members are caſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18, 19. To this everlaſting fire the Goats are adjudged, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. In this fire, thoſe that worſhip the Beaſt are tormented, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. And the Sodomites at this very day, ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 7. Into this fire ſhall all barren and unfruitful Chriſtians be caſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>And now alſo the Ax is laid unto the root of the trees, therefore every tree which bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down, and caſt into the fire.</hi> Negative goodneſs will never ſecure a man either from the Ax, or from the fire. Yea, every man and woman under Heaven, that keeps off from Chriſt, and that lives and dies out of Chriſt, and that are never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a marriage union with Chriſt: they ſhall all be caſt into this fire, John 15. 6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40825:154"/> 
               <hi>caſt forth as a branch that is withered, and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned.</hi> Thus you ſee, how the Scripture runs. Now you know, that 'tiſt ſafeſt for us, to adhere to the very letter of the Scripture, unleſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and neceſſary occaſion draw us from a literal interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To this fire is aſcribed Sulphur, flames, wood, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Iſa. 30. 33. <hi>For Tophet is ordained of old</hi> (that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But yet remember this, that that God that makes the damned live without food, is able to maintain this fire without wood. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Fire is the moſt furious of all Elements; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> therefore the bodies of men can't be more exquiſitely tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, than with fire. The bodies that ſinned on earth, <note place="margin">Water doth only kill, but fire doth vex, terrifie and torment in killing. <hi>Act.</hi> &amp; <hi>Mon.</hi>
               </note> ſhall be puniſhed and tormented in Hell. Now what can be more grievous and vexatious, more afflicting and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting to the bodies of men, than material fire. <hi>Bilney</hi> the Martyr could not endure to hold his finger in the flame of a Candle for a little while, for a quarter of an hour, though he tryed to do it before he burnt at the ſtake. O then how will the bodies of men endure to dwell in unquenchable fire, to dwell in everlaſting burnings. The Brick-kilns of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Furnace of <hi>Babel</hi> are but as the glowing ſparkle, or as the blaze of a Bruſh-faggot, to this tormenting <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> that has been prepared of old, to puniſh the bodies of ſinners with. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Several of the Fathers &amp; Schools, generally agree, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that the fire which ſhall torment the wicked in Hell, ſhall be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40825:155"/> material fire: but yet they ſay, that this material fire ſhall won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zaach. Auſtia, Peter Lumbard. Tho. Aqu. Gregory,</hi> &amp;c.</note> exceed ours, both in degree of heat, and fierceneſs of burning. Our Elementary or Culinary fire is no more to be compared with the fire of Hell, than fire painted upon the Wall, is to be compared with fire burning in our Chimneys. <hi>Si igne damnabit reprobos, quare non in igne cruciabit dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natos,</hi> ſayes one of the Antients, If he will judge the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in fire, why not condemn them to fire.</p>
            <p>But if it be material fire, then it may be quencht: beſides we <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> ſee by common experience, that material fire in a ſhort time will conſume and ſpend it ſelf. Neither can we ſee how material fire can make impreſſions upon Spirits, as the Devils and ſouls of men are.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Don't we find, that the Buſh burned and was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed? <label type="milestone">

            <p>Secondly, Such as thus object, draw things to the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of their own Reaſon, which may be many wayes of a dangerous conſequence, both to themſelves and others. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch as go about to make the fire of Hell only ſpiritual fire, they go about to make it no fire at all; for it paſſeth the natural fire, to be ſpiritual. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſee in this life, that bodily tortures work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ſpirits in the ſame bodies: And why may it not be ſo in Hell? Don't men by their daily experience find, that their ſouls are frequently afflicted in, and under corporeal diſtempers, diſeaſes and weakneſſes? Doubtleſs God can by his Allmighty Power infuſe ſuch power into material fire,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40825:155"/> as to make it the inſtrument of his dreadful wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to plague, puniſh, ſcorch and burn the ſouls of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners. Bodies and ſouls are co-partners in the ſame ſins, and therefore God may make them co-partners in the ſame puniſhments.

God is the God of Nature, as well as the God of Grace: and therefore I can't ſee, how the fire of Hell can be ſaid, how to act againſt its own nature, when it do; but act according to the will and command of the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I readily grant, that if you conſider infernal fire in it ſelf, or in its own nature, and ſo it cannot have any power on ſuch a ſpiritual ſubſtance as the ſoul of man is; but if you conſider infernal fire, as an inſtrument in an Allmighty hand, and ſo it can act upon ſuch ſpiritual Beings, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned ſouls are, and make the ſame dreadful and <note place="margin">

It is much diſputed and controverted among the Schoolmen, how the Devils can be tormented with corporeal fire, ſeeing they are Spirits, and (as I ſuppoſe) it is well concluded of them thus.

            <p>Fourthly, It is not ſafe to leave the plain letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to Allegorize, and whether the opinion of Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical fire in Hell, hath not been an introduction to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that many have taken up in theſe dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no other Hell, but what is within us; I ſhall not now ſtand to determine. I know <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome others, are for the Allegory; and they give this for a Reaſon, that there is mention made of Wood, and of a Worm, as well as fire. Now theſe are Allegorical; and therefore the fire is Allegorical alſo. But by their favour, we find in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that thoſe things which are ſpoken together, are not alwayes taken in the ſame nature and manner. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15, 18, 30, 31. 2 Sam. 22. 47. 1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> Chriſt is called, the <hi>Rock of our ſalvation.</hi> Now the Rock is Allegorical, Is our ſalvation, therefore Allegorical. So likewiſe Luke 22. 30. <hi>Ye ſhall eat and drink</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>at my Table in my Kingdom:</hi> Eating and drinking is Allegorical; is therefore the Kingdom Allegorical too? Allegories are not to be admitted, but where the Scripture it ſelf doth warrant them: and commonly where an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory is propounded, there it is alſo expounded. As in Galat. 4. 24. <hi>Which things are an Allegory; for theſe are the two Teſtaments.</hi> Many men have been too wanton with Allegories. <hi>Origen, Ambroſe, Hierom</hi> and ſeveral others
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40825:156"/> of the Ancients, have been blamed for it by learned men. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, I cannot tell but that the fire by which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the damned ſhall be puniſhed, may be partly material, and partly ſpiritual: partly material, to work upon the body; and partly ſpiritual, to torment the ſoul. Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> puts this Queſtion, Is it a material fire, wherewith the damned in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr. Gouge</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>Sect.</hi> 98.</note> Hell are tormented? and gives this anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> This is too curious a point to reſolve to the full; but yet this anſwer may ſafely be returned, It is no waſting or conſuming fire, but a torturing: and ſo far corporal, as it tormenteth the body: and ſo far incorporeal, as it tormenteth the ſoul. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeaking of Hell, ſaith, I was never there my ſelf, neither have I ever ſpoke with any that came from thence. Suppoſe, ſaith One, there be no fire in Hell, yet I aſſure thee this, that thou ſhalt be ſcorched with fire: the fire of Gods <note place="margin">Mr. Boulton.</note> wrath ſhall torment thee more, than bodily fire can do: and therefore it will be your wiſdom, not ſo much to queſtion this or that about Hell fire, as to make it your work, your buſineſs, not to come there. He gave good counſel, who <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> ſaid, Let us go down to Hell while we are alive, that we may not go to Hell when we are dead. And ſo did he, who ſpeaking of Hell ſaid, <hi>Ne quaeramus ubi ſit, ſed quomodo illam</hi>

               <hi>fugiamus. Let us not ſeek where it is, but how we ſhall avoid it.</hi> The ſame Author gives this further counſel; <hi>viz.</hi> That at all Banquets, Feaſts, and Publick Meetings, men ſhould talk of Helliſh pains and torments, that ſo their hearts may be over-awed, and they provoked to avoid them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves againſt them.

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives this pious counſel, Let us earneſtly importune the Lord, that this knowledge, whether the fire of Hell be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial or not, be never manifeſted to us by experience. 'Tis infinitely better, to endeavour the avoiding Hell fire, than cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to diſpute about it. Look, as there is nothing more grievous than Hell: So there is nothing more profitable than the fear of it.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40825:157"/>
            <p>But what difference is there between our common fire and Hell <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
               </label> fire?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, a mighty difference, a vaſt difference. Take it <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> in theſe ſix particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They differ in their heat: no heart can conceive, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> no tongue can expreſs the exquiſite heat of infernal fire, were all the fires under Heaven contracted into one fire; yea, were all the Coles, Wood, Oyle, Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tarr, Brimſtone, and all other combuſtibles in the world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into one flame into one fire, yet one ſpark of infernal fire would be more hot, violent, dreadful, amazing, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, raging and tormenting, than all that fire that is (ſuppoſedly) made up of all the combuſtibles the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. To mans ſenſe there is nothing more terrible and afflictive, than fire: and of all fires, there is none ſo ſcalding and tormenting, as that of brimſtone. Now into that lake <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 10. Chap. 21. 8. The fire in a <hi>Lantskip</hi> is but <hi>ignis pictus</hi> a painted fire, and the fire of Purgatory is but <hi>ignis fictus,</hi> feigned fire. Now what are theſe to Hell fire?</note> which burns with fire and brimſtone for ever and ever, ſhall the wicked of the earth be caſt. Infernal fire far exceeds ours (that are on our Hearths, and in our Chimneyes) in degree of heat and fierceneſs of burning. Our fire hath not that terrible power to ſcorch, burn, torment, as the fire of Hell hath. Our fire (as <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and others ſay) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Hell fire, is but like painted fire upon the Wall. Now you know, a painted fire upon the Wall will not hurt you, nor burn, nor affright you, not torment you, but the fire of Hell will beyond all your conception and expreſſion, hurt, burn, affright and torment you. The fire of Hell for degrees of heat, and fierceneſs of burning, muſt wonderfully ſurpaſs our moſt furious fires, becauſe it is purpoſely created by God to torment the creature, whereas our ordinary fire was created by God, only for the comfort of the creature. The greateſt and the hotteſt fires that ever were on earth, are <note place="margin">Alſted.</note> but Ice in compariſon of the fire of Hell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are unexpreſſible torments in Hell, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> well as unſpeakable joyes in Heaven. Some who write of Purgatory, tell us, that the pains thereof are more exquiſite

            <p>Secondly, Our fire is made by the hand of man, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> muſt be maintained by continual ſupplies of fuel: take away the Coals, the Wood, the combuſtible matter, and the fire goes out: but the infernal fire is created, and tempered, and blown by the hand of an angry ſin revenging God.

               <hi>fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of Brimſtone, doth kindle it:</hi> and therefore the breath of all the Reprobates in Hell ſhall never be able to blow it out. Our fire is blown by an aiery breath, but the infernal fire is blown by the angry breath of the great God, which burns far hotter, than ten thouſand, thouſand Rivers of Brimſtone.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40825:158"/> The breath of Gods mouth, ſhall be both Bellows and fuel to the infernal fire: and therefore Oh how terrible and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing, how fierce and raging will that fire be. If but three drops of Brimſtone ſhould fall upon any part of the fleſh of a man, it would fill him ſo full of torment, that he would not be able to forbear roaring out, for pain and anguiſh. Oh how dreadful and painful will it be then, for damned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſwimm up and down in a Lake or River of Fire and Brimſtone for ever and ever. There is no proportion between the heat of our breath, and the fire that it blows. O then what a dreadful, what an amazing, what an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire muſt that needs be, which is blown by a breath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into brimſtone. Gods wrath and indignation ſhall be an everlaſting ſupply to Hells conflagration. Ah Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how fearful, how formidable, how unconceivable will this infernal fire prove! Surely, there is no miſery, no torment to that of lying in a torrent of burning Brimſtone for ever and ever. Mark this infernal fire is a fire prepared by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to puniſh and torment all impenitent perſons and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate rebels: who ſcorned to ſubmit to the Scepter of Chriſt. <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 41.</note> 
               <hi>for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> The wiſdom of God hath been much exerciſed in preparing and deviſing the moſt tormenting temper for that formidable fire, in which the Devil and his Angels ſhall be puniſhed for ever and ever. Not as if it were not prepared alſo for wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: but it is ſaid to be prepared for the Devil and his Angels; becauſe it was firſtly and chiefly prepared for them. All impenitent ſinners, ſhall have the Devil and his Angels for their conſtant companions: and therefore they ſhall be ſure to ſhear with them in the extremity and inevitableneſs of their torments. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our fire when it burneth, it ſhineth, it caſts a light. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Our fire burns, and in burning ſhines, light is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral property of our common fire: 'tis true, the elementary fire in its own ſphere ſhineth not, becauſe of its ſubtilneſs, and the infernal fire of Hell ſhineth not, becauſe of its groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet our ordinary fire (being of a mixt nature) hath
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40825:158"/> light as well as heat in it, and thats our comfort. It hath light to ſhew it ſelf to us, and to our ſelves, and it hath light to ſhew others to us, and us to others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some men can work, as well as talk by the light of the fire.

Yet this horrid darkneſs was nothing to the darkneſs of Hell; the darkneſs of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was but as an over caſting for three dayes, Exod. 10. 22, 23. <hi>And there was a thick darkneſs in all the Land of Aegypt three dayes. They ſaw not one another, neither roſe any from his place three dayes.</hi> For three dayes they were deprived not only of the natural lights and lamps of Heaven, but of all artificial light alſo. 'Tis poſſible that the vapours might be ſo thick and moiſt as to put out their Candles, and all other lights that were kindled by them. 'Tis probable, that they had neither light from Sun, Moon, or Stars above, nor yet from fire or candle below: ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat they were as blind men, that could not ſee at all, and as lame men, that could not move from their places: and ſo they ſate ſtill as under the arreſt of this darkneſs, becauſe they could not ſee what to do, nor whither to go. God would teach them the worth of light, by the want of it. Some think, that by that dreadful Judgement of thick darkneſs, they were filled with that terror and horror, that they durſt not ſo much as move from the places where they were ſate down. But after theſe three dayes of darkneſs were over, the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> enjoyed the glorious light of the Sun again. O but ſinners are in Hell, when they are in chains of darkneſs, when they are in blackneſs of darkneſs, they ſhall never ſee light more. Hell is a houſe without light. <hi>Gregory</hi> and all other Authors that I have caſt my eye upon, agree in this, that though our fire hath light as well as heat; yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal fire hath only heat to burn ſinners: It has no light to refreſh ſinners; and this will be no ſmall addition to their torment. A Philoſopher being asked, Whether it were not a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun? anſwered, that that was a blind mans queſtion. Surely life without light, is but a lifeleſs life. But,</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it is a juſt and righteous thing with God, that ſuch bodies and ſouls that have ſinned (impenitently) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould be tormented everlaſtingly together. To this purpoſe, the Hebrew Doctors have a very pretty Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man planted an Orchard, and going from home, <note place="margin">Pet. Mart.</note> was careful to leave ſuch Watchmen, as might both keep it from ſtrangers, and not deceive him themſelves: therefore he appointed one blind, but ſtrong of his limbs, and the other ſeeing, but a Cripple. Theſe two in their Maſters abſence conſpired together, and the blind took the lame on his ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſo gathered the fruit, their Maſter returning, and finding out this ſubtilty, puniſhed them both together. Now ſo ſhall it be with thoſe two ſinful companions, the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10. 2 Theſſ. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> ſoul and the body in the great day of our Lord. With <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> they have been brethren in iniquity, and ſo ſhall be in eternal miſery. As body and ſoul have been one in ſinning, ſo they ſhall be one in ſuffering.

            <p>If after ſo many millions of years, as there be drops in the Ocean, there might be a deliverance out of hell; This would yield a little caſe, a little comfort to the damned: O but this word Eternity, Eternity, Eternity, this word Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, Everlaſting, Everlaſting, will even break the hearts of the damned in ten thouſand pieces. There is ſcarce any pain or torment here on earth, but there is ever ſome hope
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40825:161"/> of eaſe, mitigation, or intermiſſion, there is ſome hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or delivery, but in hell the torments there, are all eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, remedileſs and endleſs. Here if one fall into the fire, he may like a brand be pulled out of it, and ſaved; but out of that fiery Lake, there is no redemption. That Majeſty that the ſinner hath offended and provoked, is an infinite Majeſty. Now there muſt be ſome proportion betwixt the ſinners ſin, and his puniſhment and torment. Now the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being a finite creature, he is not capable of bearing the weight of that puniſhment or torment that is intenſively infinite, becauſe it would be his aboliſhing or annihilating; and therefore he muſt bear the weight of that puniſhment or torment that is extenſively infinite; namely, <hi>duratione infinita,</hi> infinite in the continuance and endurance. What is wanting in torment, muſt be made up in time. Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire and everlaſting puniſhment in the New Teſtament, <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 2 Theſſ. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.

And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules and Maximes of right reaſon, doth neceſſarily import a puniſhment of the ſame duration, that the reward is. Now the Reward of the Saints in that other world, is granted on all hands to be everlaſting, to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and therefore the puniſhment of the damned, can't be but everlaſting and eternal too. The Rewards of the Elect ſhall never be ended; therefore the puniſhment of the damned ſhall never be ended: becauſe as the mercy of God is infinite towards the elect, ſo the Juſtice of God is infinite towards the Reprobate in hell: The Reprobate ſhall have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment <note place="margin">Drexel.</note> without pity, miſery without mercy, ſorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccour, crying without compaſſion, miſchief without meaſure, and torment without end.

Now what an infinite diſtance and diſproportion, is there between the Lord of Hoſts and ſuch poor crawling Worms as we are, he being holineſs, and we ſinfulneſs; he fulneſs, and we emptineſs; he omnipotency, and we impotency; he Majeſty, and we vanity; he <hi>(inſtar omnium)</hi> all in all, and we nothing at all.

The guilt and ſtain of ſin, of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and unpardoned, endures eternally upon the ſoul; and therefore what can follow, but eternal torments. The laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continuance of ſin, is remarkably deſeribed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40825:165"/> 
               <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 17. 1. <hi>The ſin of</hi> Judah <hi>is written with a Pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond; it is graven upon the table of their hearts.</hi> Not only written, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven that no hand can deface it. Slight not the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſin, it periſhes not with the acting. The leaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath a perpetuity, nay, an eternity of guilt upon it. Sin leaving a blot in the ſoul, brings the matter of Hell fire, is eternally puniſhed, becauſe there is ſtill matter for that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire to work upon. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I anſwer, Though death put an end to mens lives, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> yet not to ſins. Hell is as full of ſin, as it is of puniſhment or torment. Though the Schoolmen determine, that after this life, men are capable neither of merit nor demerit; and therefore by their ſins do not incurr a greater meaſure of puniſhment; yet they grant, that they ſin ſtill. Though when the creature is actually under the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, the Law ceaſes to any further puniſhment, yet there is an obligation to the precepts of the Law ſtill. Though a man be bound only to the curſe of the Law, as he is a ſinner, yet he is bound to the precept of the Law, as he is a creature: ſo that though the demerit of ſin ceaſeth after death, yet the nature of ſin remaineth: though by ſinning they do not incurr a higher and a greater degree of puniſhment, yet as they continue ſinning, ſo it is juſt with God, there ſhould be a continuation of the puniſhment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inflicted. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I anſwer, It is no injuſtice in God, to puniſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> offences with perpetual torments. God meaſureth the puniſhment, by the greatneſs of the offence, and not by the time wherein the ſin was acted. Murder, Adultery, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Treaſon, and the like capital crimes, are doomed in the Judicatories of men, to death without mercy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to perpetual impriſonment, or to perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet theſe high offences were committed and done in a ſhort time. Now this bears a proportion with eternal torments. O Sirs, if the offences committed againſt God, be infinitely heinous, why may not the puniſhment be infinitely laſting. Sinners offences, as

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40825:167"/> of God, and would not behold that dreadful hand of his that was ſtretched out againſt them. O Sirs, God looks up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on himſelf as reproached and ſlandered, by ſuch who will not ſee his hand in the amazing Judgements that he inflicts upon them, Jer. 5. 12. <hi>They have belied the Lord, and ſaid it is not he:</hi> or as the Hebrew runs, <hi>he is not.</hi> Such was the Atheiſm of the Jews, that they ſlighted divine warnings, and deſpiſed all thoſe dreadful threatnings (of the Sword, Famine and Fire) which ſhould have lead them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo tacitely ſaid, the Lord is not God: ſuch who either ſay, that God is not omniſcient, or that he is not om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, or that he is not ſo juſt, as to execute the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he has threatned. Such belie the Lord, ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to be God. Many feel the rod, that cannot hear it; and many experience the ſmart of the rod, that don't ſee the hand that holds the rod; and this is ſad. How can the natural man without faiths proſpective, look ſo high, as to ſee the hand of the Lord in waſting and deſtroying Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By common experience we find, that natural men are mightily apt to father the evil of all their ſufferings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecondary cauſes: ſometimes they cry out, this is from a diſtemper in nature, and at other times they cry out, this is from a bad Air: Sometimes they cry out of the malice, Plots, envy and rage of men; and at other times they cry out of Stars, Chance and Fortune, and ſo fix upon any thing, rather than the hand of God. But now a gracious Chriſtian under all his ſufferings, he overlooks all ſecondary cauſes, and fixes his eye upon the hand of God. You know what <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his unnatural Brethren, who fold him <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 7.</note> for a ſlave; <hi>Non vos, ſed Deus; 'Twas not you, but God that ſent me into Aegypt. Job</hi> met with many ſore loſſes and ſad croſſes, but under them all, he over-lookt all inſtruments, all ſecondary cauſes; he over-looks the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> and Satan, and fixes his eye upon the hand of God: <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>the name of the Lord. Judas,</hi> and <hi>Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and the bloody Souldiers, had all a deep hand in the ſufferings of Chriſt, but yet he over-looks them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40825:167"/> all, and fixes his eye upon his fathers hand. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it.</hi> This cup was <note place="margin">John 18. 11.</note> the cup of his ſufferings. Now in all his ſad ſufferings h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 12. <hi>And he hath confirmed his words which he ſpake againſt us, and againſt our Judges that judged us, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done, as hath been done upon Jeruſalem.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>The Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doth; for we obeyed not his voice.</hi> God is only righteous, he is perfectly righteous, he is exemplarily righteous, he is everlaſtingly righteous, he is infinitely righteous, and no unrighteouſneſs dwells in him. There are four things that God can't do: <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 15. Job 36. 23.</note> 1. He can't lie. 2. He can't die. 3. He ca'nt deny himſelf: Nor 4.

God has a Soverainty over all your perſons and concernments in this world; and therefore he may do with you, and all that is yours as he pleaſeth: upon this account you ought to ſay, The Lord is righteous, though he hath laid your habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſolate, and burnt up your houſes before your eyes.

Others by this houſe, underſtand Heaven, that upper houſe, that houſe of State, in which Chriſt ſaith there are many Manſions; but this can't, becauſe the houſe in the Text, is ſuch a houſe, to which Wiſdom doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately invite, and call all her gueſts. But 4. and laſtly, Others by houſe, underſtand the Church of Chriſt on earth, for the Church Militant, is a houſe built up of many lively ſtones: <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> and with theſe I cloſe. Now by theſe Scriptures, it is very plain, that Gods houſe is his Church, and his Church his houſe. Now if you were enemies to Gods houſe, if you hated his houſe, and deſigned and endeavoured to pull down his houſe; no wonder that the Lord has laid your <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 37, 38.

By the death of Chriſt all religious differences of places is taken away: So that no one place is holier than another. Before the coming of Chriſt, the whole Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (becauſe it was a Type of the Church of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, and of the Kingdom of Heaven) was eſteemed by Gods people, a better and holier place, than any other in the world. And upon that ground among others, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> were ſo <note place="margin">Gen. 47. 29, 31. Chap. 49. 29.</note> deſirous to be buried there. And in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſome places are ſaid to have been more holy than others, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as wherein God did manifeſt himſelf in a ſpecial and ſenſible manner. So the place where Chriſt appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the fiery Buſh, is called <hi>Holy Ground:</hi> and ſo was that wherein he appeared to <hi>Joſhua.</hi> And the Mount <note place="margin">Exod. 3 5. Joſh. 5. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> whereon Chriſt was transfigured, is called by <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Holy Mount.</hi> But theſe places were no longer accounted holy, than during the time of this ſpecial preſence of the Lord in them. So <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called the <hi>Holy City:</hi> yea, at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 5. Chap. 27. 53.</note> of Chriſts death, it is called the <hi>Holy City;</hi> becauſe it was a City ſet apart by God for a holy uſe, a City where he was daily worſhipped; a City that he had choſen to put his name upon. Though <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a very wicked City, yea the wickedſt City in all the world (counting the means
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40825:172"/> they enjoyed) yet 'tis called the <hi>Holy City:</hi> and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in reſpect of ſeparation and dedication, it was h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lier than any other City or place in the world beſides. So the Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is nine times called the <hi>Holy Temple;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 5. 7. 11. 4. 65. 4. 79. 1. 138 2. Jonah 2. 4, 7. Mich. 1. 2.

This may be made evident three wayes. Firſt, There was a place where the people ſtood ſeparated from the Prieſts, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 10. And this was ſo holy a place, that Chriſt would not ſuffer any to carry any veſſel through it. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k</hi> 16. 11. And Secondly, There was a place where the Prieſts executed their Miniſtry, which was holier than that that the people ſtood in, and is therefore called the Holy Place, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 30. And Thirdly, There was a place which the High Prieſt might only enter into, and that but once a year, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that is called the Holy of Holies, the holieſt place of all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 3. But now ſince the death of Chriſt, there is no place in the world, that is holier than other. The prayer of faith is as powerful and as prevalent with God in one place, as in another <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes the faithful to be ſuch, as call upon <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2. 1 Tim. 2. 8.

               </gap>ithfully, and yet was oppreſſed cruelly; having all his goods taken from him by an exacting Knight, whereupon in a melancholy humour, he perſwaded himſelf, that God was dead, who had formerly been ſo faithful to him, and now (as he thought) had left him: It ſo fell out, that an old man met him, and deſired him to deliver a Letter into the hands of his oppreſſor: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt and peruſal of which, the Knight was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that immediately he confeſſed his fault, and reſtored the poor man his goods; which made the poor man ſay, Now I ſee, that God may ſeem to ſleep, but can never dye. If God has taken away all: yet remember, that God has a thouſand thouſand wayes to make up all thy loſſes to thee, which thou knoweſt not of; therefore do'nt murmur, don't fret, do'nt faint, nor do'nt limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If thou madeſt no improvement of thy houſe, thy eſtate, thy Trade, then 'tis thy wiſdom and thy work, rather to be diſpleaſed with thy ſelf for thy non improvement of mercies, than to be diſcontented at that hand of Heaven, that hath deprived thee of thy mercies. Remember Oh ye burnt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London,</hi> that you are not the firſt that have loſt your all. Beſides the inſtances already cited, you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they ſuffered in the tenth and eleventh Chapters of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and you muſt remember that in the Ten Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions many thouſands of the people of God were ſtript
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40825:178"/> of their all: and ſo were very many alſo in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes, who ſhrugs or complains of a common Lot? It was grace upon the Throne, that thou enjoyedſt thy houſe, thy eſtate, thy Trade ſo long, and therefore it concerns thee to be rather thankful, that thy mercies were continued ſo long unto thee, than to murmur becauſe thou art now ſtript of all. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When all is gone, yet mercy may be near, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> thou not ſee it. When <hi>Hagars</hi> Bottle was empty, the Well <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 19.</note> of Water was near, though ſhe ſaw it not. Mercies many times are never nearer to us, than when with <hi>Hagar</hi> we ſit down and weep, becauſe our bottle is empty, becauſe our ſtreams of mercy are dried up. The Well was there before, but ſhe ſaw it not, till her eyes were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Though mercy be near, though it be even at the door, yet till the great God ſhall irradiate both the Organ and the object, we can neither ſee our mercies, nor ſuck the breaſts of mercy. Chriſt the ſpring of mercy, the fountain of mercy, was near the Diſciples, yea, he talked with the Diſciples, and yet they <note place="margin">Luke 24. 15.</note> knew him not. Look, as dangers are neareſt to wicked men when they ſee them not, when they fear them not: As <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

            <p>Sixthly, I anſwer, That God many times by taking away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſome outward mercies, comforts and contentments, dos but make way for greater and better mercies to come in the room of thoſe he has taken away. He took from <hi>David</hi> an <note place="margin">Pſa 71. 20, 21.</note>

            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, Though thou haſt loſt all thy outward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> comforts in this world, yet if thou art a believer, there are ten choice Jewels, that thou ſhalt never, that thou canſt never loſe.</p>

There can be no Divorce between Chriſt and the believing ſoul. Chriſt hates putting away.

Chriſt and believers are ſo incorporated, as if Chriſt and they were one lump. Our nature is now joyned to God by the indiſſolvable tye of the Hypoſtatical Union in the ſecond Perſon: and we in our perſons, are joyned to God, by the Myſtical indiſſolvable bond of the Spirit, the third Perſon.

               <hi>Sodom;</hi> yet <hi>Lot</hi> was carried away in the Captivity of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as co-habiting with them. And ſo though many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants of the Lord in <hi>London,</hi> were not guilty of thoſe groſs impieties, that their neighbours were guilty of; yet co-habiting either with them, or near them, they were burnt up and deſtroyed with them. <hi>Achans</hi> Family were not guilty of <hi>Achans</hi> Sacriledge, and yet <hi>Achans</hi> Family were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for <hi>Achans</hi> Sacriledge. The burning of <hi>London</hi> was a National Judgement; and this National Judgement, was the product of National ſins, as I have formerly proved. Now mark, though the people of God may be perſonally innocent, yet becauſe they are members of a nocent body, they are liable to undergo the temporal ſmart of National Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Doubtleſs a whole City may be laid deſolate for the wickedneſs of one man, or of a few men, that dwelleth in it, Eccleſ. 9. 18. <hi>One ſinner deſtroyeth much good.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When good men who can't be juſtly charged with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> publick ſins, do yet fall with wicked men by publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you muſt remember, that God has ſeveral different ends, in inflicting one and the ſame Judgements, both upon the good and upon the bad. The mettal and the droſs go <note place="margin">Zech. 13. 9. Eccl. 8. 12, 13.</note> both into the fire together, but the droſs is conſumed, and the mettal refined. The ſtalk and the ear of corn, fall upon the threſhing floor, under one and the ſame Flayl; but the one is ſhattered in pieces, the other is preſerved. From one

               </gap> Judgements that befall the wicked, may befall the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but not upon the ſame accompt. The righteous are caſt into the Furnance for tryal; but the wicked for their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.

The very ſelf ſame Judgement that is as a Load-ſtone to draw the righteous towards Heaven, will be as a Mill-ſtone to ſink the wicked down to Hell. The Pillar of fire that went before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had a light ſide and a dark ſide; <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 20.</note> the light ſide was towards Gods people, and the dark ſide was towards the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> flames of <hi>London</hi> will prove ſuch a Pillar both to the righteous and the wicked, That will certainly be made good upon the righteous and the wicked, whoſe habitations have been deſtroyed by <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> flames: that the Greek Epigramm ſpeaks of the Silver Ax the Enſign of Juſtice.</p>

            <p>Thoſe dreadful Judgements that have been the Ax of Gods revenging Juſtice, to wound and break the wicked in pieces, ſhall be righteous mens cures, and their Golden reſtoratives. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, God ſometimes wraps up his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> with the wicked in deſolating Judgements; that he may before all the world wipe off that reproach, which Atheiſts and wicked men are apt to caſt upon him, as if he were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, as if he were a reſpecter of perſons; and as if his wayes <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 25. 29. Chap. 33. 20.</note> were not juſt and equall. God to ſtop the mouth of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the mouth of blaſphemy, hath made his own people as deſolate as others by that fiery calamity that has paſt upon them. Such men that have been eye witneſſes of Gods impartial dealing with his own people in thoſe dayes when <hi>London</hi> was in flames, muſt ſay, that God is neither partial
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40825:184"/> nor fond. And let thus much ſuffice, by way of Anſwer to this Objection.</p>
            <p>The third Duty that lyes upon thoſe that have been burnt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> up, is for them in patience to poſſeſs their own ſouls, and <note place="margin">Luke 21. 19.</note> quietly to acquieſce in what the Lord has done.

               </gap>he world, are not ſo near and dear to a man as his children are. In this ſtory concerning <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, there are many things remarkable. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he had loſt two of his Sons, yea, two of his eldeſt Sons together at a clap.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe two were the moſt honourable of the Sons of <hi>Aaron:</hi> as we may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 1. in that they only with their Father and the ſeventy Elders are appointed to come up to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were cut off by a ſudden and unexpected death, when neither themſelves nor their Father, thought their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine had been ſo near. What miſery to that of being ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized by a doleful death?</p>
            <p n="4">4. They were cut off by a way which might ſeem to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Gods hot diſpleaſure againſt them: for they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by fire from God. They ſinned by fire, and they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by fire. Look, as fire came from the Lord before in mercy; ſo now fire is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt from the Lord in Judgement. Certainly the manner of their death, pointed out the ſin for which they were ſmitten. Now what Father had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40825:184"/> loſe all his children at once, by an ordinary ſtroke of death, than to ſee one of them deſtroyed by Gods immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand in ſuch a terrible manner.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They were thus ſmitten by the Lord on the very firſt day of their entring upon that high honour of their Prieſtly Function; and when their hearts were doubtleſs full of joy, now to be ſuddenly thunder-ſtruck in ſuch a Sun-ſhine day of mercy, as this ſeemed to be, muſt needs add weight to their calamity and miſery.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They were cut off with ſuch great ſeverity for a very ſmall offence, if reaſon may be permitted to ſit as Judge in the caſe. They were made monuments of divine vengeance only for taking fire to burn the Incenſe, from one place, when they ſhould have taken it from another. And this they did (ſay ſome) not purpoſely, but through miſtake, and at ſuch a time, when they had much work lying upon their hands, and were but newly entred upon their new employment. Now notwithſtanding all this <hi>Aaron</hi> held his peace. It may be, at firſt, when he ſaw his Sons devoured by fire, his heart began to wrangle, and his paſſions began to work: but when he conſidered the righteouſneſs of God on the one hand, and the glory that God would get to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the other hand; he preſently checks himſelf, and layes his hand upon his mouth, and ſtands ſtill and ſilent before the Lord. Though it be not eaſie in great afflictions with <hi>Aaron,</hi> to hold our peace; yet it is very advantageous: which the Heathens ſeemed to intimate, in placing the Image of <hi>Angeronia,</hi> with the mouth bound upon the Altar of <hi>Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> to ſhew, that they do prudently and patiently bear, and conceal their troubles, ſorrows and anxieties, they ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to comfort at laſt.

               <hi>ergo</hi> be thankful though God has laid all your pleaſant things deſolate. 6. Thankfulneſs under croſſes and loſſes, ſpeak out much integrity and ingenuity of Spirit. Hypocrites and prophane perſons are more apt to blaſpheme, than to bleſs a taking God: <hi>ergo</hi> be thankful. The Ancients ſay, <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dixeris omnia dixeris,</hi> ſay a man is unthankful, and ſay he is any thing. Ingratitude is a Monſter in nature (ſay ſome) a Soleciſm in Manners, a Paradox in Grace, damming up the courſe of donations divine and humane. If there be any ſin in the world againſt the Holy Ghoſt, (ſaid Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in a Letter to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France)</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. The Laws of <hi>Perſia, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the ungrateful to death: and unthankfulneſs may well be ſtyled the Epitome of Vices. Ingratitude was ſo hateful to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that they uſed to make Eunuchs of ungrateful perſons, that no poſterity of theirs might remain. Well Sirs, remember this, the beſt way to get much, is to be thankful for a little. God loves to ſow much where he reaps much. Thankfulneſs for one mercy, makes way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercy; as many thouſand Chriſtians have experienced. The Lords Impoſt for all his bleſſings is our thankfulneſs: if we neglect to pay this Impoſt, the commodity is forfeit,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40825:191"/> and ſo will take it back. Our returnes muſt be according to our receipts. Good men ſhould be like the Bells, that ring as pleaſantly at a Funeral, as at a Wedding. They ſhould be as thankful when it goes ill with them, as when it goes well with them. <hi>Cicero</hi> complained of old, that it was a hard thing to find a thankful man. Oh how hard a thing is it to find burnt Citizens really, cordially, frequently and practically thankful, that they are alive, that they are out of the grave, out of Hell, and that yet they have bread to eat and clothes to wear, though their habitations are laid in aſhes, and all their pleaſant things deſtroyed. But,</p>
            <p>The eighth Duty that lyes upon thoſe who have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> burnt up, is to keep in their hearts a conſtant Remembrance of the late dreadful conflagration. God expects that his children ſhould commemorate his Judgements as well as his mercies. The ſore Judgement that God inflicted upon <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 8, 9. Pſal. 119. 30. 120.</note> 
               <hi>Sodom,</hi> is mentioned thirteen times in the bleſſed Scripture, and all to work us to mind it, and to abhorr thoſe ſins that laid that City deſolate. The Lord looks that his people ſhould keep up freſh in their memories ſuch Judgements that have been long before executed, Jer. 7. 12. <hi>Go to my place which was in Shilo, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my people.</hi> The Ark <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 10, 11.</note> of old ſtood at <hi>Shilo,</hi> but after it was taken and carried away by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> it was never brought back, and from that time <hi>Shilo</hi> lay ever after deſolate. And this the Lord would have engraven upon their memories, and upon their hearts. Though ſtony hearts are bad, yet Iron memories are good. Luke 17. 32. <hi>Remember Lots wife.</hi> Conſider her ſin and her puniſhment; that ſo fearing the one, you may learn to take heed of the other. 2 Pet. 2. 6. <hi>And turning the Cities of</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>into aſhes, condemned them with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, making them an enſample unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly.</hi> There is much in thoſe words, <hi>That after ſhould live ungodly:</hi> Why hath God turned thoſe rich and populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into aſhes, and ſet them up as burning Beacon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but to warn all the world, that they live not ungodly; and to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40825:192"/> work them to keep alive in their memories the deſolating Judgements of God. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay, that the Jews at this day, when they are to boild an houſe, they are to leave one part of it unfiniſhed and lying Rude, in remembrance that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple, are at preſent deſolate.

            <p n="4">4. A ſerious commemoration of Gods Judgements, is a thing that is highly pleaſing to the Lord.

            <p>The ninth Duty that lyes upon thoſe who have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> burnt up, is, to ſee the vanity, mutability and uncertainty of all worldly comforts and enjoyments, and accordingly to <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17. 1 John 2. 17.

Behold in four dayes time, a glorious City is turned into a ruinous heap: and a little world of wealth is laid in aſhes, and many hundreds of families almoſt reduced to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. And are not theſe loud Sermons of the vanity, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability and uncertainty of all earthly things. Thats good advice <hi>Solomon</hi> gives, Prov. 23. 4, 5. <hi>Labour not to be rich. Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an Eagle towards</hi>

               <hi>heaven.</hi> All certainty that is in riches, is that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Riches, like bad ſervants, never ſtay long with one Maſter. Did not the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſee their riches fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from them upon the wings of the fire, and of the wind, when their own and their neighbours habitations were all in flames. O Sirs, what certainty can there be in thoſe things, which Balls of Fire, Storms at Sea, falſe Oaths, or treacherous friends, may in a few dayes, yea, in a day, an hour, deprive us off. God can ſoon clap a pair of wings upon all a man has in this world. And therefore he acts ſafeſt and wiſeſt, who ſits moſt looſe from the things of the world. Riches are not for ever: and the Crown doth not <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 4.</note> endure to every generation. This <hi>Adonibezek, Belſhazzar,</hi> and many other great Princes have found by experience, as Scripture and Hiſtories do ſufficiently teſtifie. In all the Ages of the world the Teſtimony of <hi>Solomon</hi> holds good, Eccleſ. 1. 2. <hi>Vanity of vanity, ſaith the Preacher; vanity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, all is vanity.</hi> The things of this world are not only vain, but vanity in the abſtract.

All the great, the gay, the glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious things of the world, may fitly be reſembled to the fruit that undid us all, which was fair to the ſight, ſmooth in handling, ſweet in taſte, but deadly in operation. A man may be happy that is not wealthy, witneſs <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> thoſe worthies of whom this world was not worthy. But how hard a thing is it for a man to be happy, that is weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Matth. 19. 24. <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel</hi> (or Cabel-rop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as ſome render it) <hi>to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> There are ſeveral expoſitions upon theſe words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some ſay, that there was a little gate in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> called the Needles-eye, which was ſo low and little, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was impoſſible for a Camel to enter in at it with his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den, and therefore when Camels came that way, they took off their loads, and the Camels themſelves were forced to ſtoop before they could paſs through that gate: ſome think that our Saviour alludes to this. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Others interpret it of a Cabel-rope or Cord: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and then thus they expound the words; A man cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any means poſſible put a Cable through a Needles eye; but if he untwiſt it, he may by thred and thred put it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Others ſay, theſe words are a proverbial Speech, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for the <hi>Talmud</hi> had a Proverb, <hi>Are ye of</hi> Pambeditha, <hi>who can cauſe an Elephant to go through a Needles eye?</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beditha</hi> were great Braggers, they would boaſt to others, that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40825:194"/> they could do very great things, and very ſtrange things. Hence came that Proverb amongſt them, It is eaſier to cauſe an Elephant to go thorough a Needles eye, than to do thus or thus. Now our Saviour uſeth the word Camel, becauſe he was better known to them. It was uſual (ſay others) with the Jews to ſay, when difficult matters were promiſed, Haſt thou been at <hi>Pam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>editha,</hi> where Camels go through the eyes of Needles? But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the plain and ſimple meaning of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Proverbial Speech, is doubtleſs this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for ſuch a rich man to be ſaved (that truſteth in his riches, and that ſets a higher price upon his riches, than upon Chriſt; and that will rather part with Chriſt, than part with his riches; and that will rather go to Hell rich, than to Heaven poor) as it is for a Camel to go thorough the eye of a N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edle. The Proverbial Speech (ſay others) notes the difficulty of rich mens being ſaved. Hab. 2. 6. <hi>Wo to him that ladeth himſelf with thick Clay.</hi> Thick Clay will ſooner break a mans back, than ſatisfie his heart. And O what a folly and madneſs is it, for a man to be ſtill a loading of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Clay of this world. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 2.

Though the rich man in the Goſpel fared, and lived like a Gentleman, a Gallant, a Knight, a Lord; yet when he dyed, he went to Hell. Though Mammon, as <hi>Aretius</hi> and <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> many others obſerve, is a <hi>Syriack</hi> word, and ſignifies riches: yet <hi>Irenaeus</hi> derives Mammon of <hi>Mum,</hi> that ſignifies a Spot, and <hi>Hon</hi> that ſignifies riches; to ſhew that riches have their ſpots: and yet O how in love are men with theſe ſpots, how <note place="margin">Iſaiah 5. 8.</note> laborious, how induſtrious are men to add ſpots to ſpots, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh that I had no juſt grounds to be jealous, that many who have been great loſers by the fire, are now more mad upon the world, and more eagerly carried after the world, than ever they have been; as if the great deſign of God in ſetting them on fire round about, was only to enlarge their deſires more after the world, and more effectually to engage them to moil and toil as in the fire, to lay up treaſure for another fire to conſume. Before I cloſe up this particular, let me offer a few things to your conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Are there none of the burnt Citizens, who ſeek the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> world in the firſt place, and Chriſt and Heaven in the laſt place; that are firſt for earth, and then for Heaven; firſt for <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.

            <p>Secondly, Are there none of the burnt Citizens, whoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> love, and hearts, and affections, are running more out after the world, than they are after God, and Chriſt, and the <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6 9.

The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> were a ſort of Profeſſors, that made no uſe of their Religion, but to their ſecular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and therefore when the world and their Religion ſtood in competition, they made no ſcruple, no bones of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their profeſſion, to enjoy the world.

            <p>Fourthly, Are there none of the burnt Citizens, who daily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> prefer the world before Chriſt? yea, the worſt of the world, before the beſt of Chriſt? The <hi>Gergeſins</hi> preferred their Swine <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 28. ult.</note> before a Saviour; they had rather loſe Chriſt, than loſe their Hoggs. They had rather that the Devil ſhould ſtill poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> men that are mad upon the world, will deſire this. <hi>Bernard</hi> had rather be in his Chimney corner with Chriſt, than in Heaven without him: At ſo high a rate he valued Chriſt. There was a good man who once cryed out, I had rather have one Chriſt, than a thouſand worlds. Another mourn ed, becauſe he could not prize Chriſt enough. But how few burnt Citizens are of theſe mens minds? It was a ſweet prayer of one; <hi>Make thy Son dear, very dear, exceeding dear, only dear and precious to me, or not at all.</hi> But do all burnt Citizens lift up ſuch a prayer. I ſuppoſe you have either read or heard of that rich and wretched Cardinal, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he would not leave his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for a part in Paradiſe. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Are there no burnt Citizens, who follow the world ſo cloſe, that they gain no good by the word: like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers, and like the ſtony ground. Some Writers <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31, 32, 33. Matth. 13. 22.</note> ſay, that nothing will grow where Gold grows. Certainly where an inordinate love of the world grows, there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40825:196"/> will grow that is good. A heart filled either with the love of the world, or with the profits of the world, or with the pleaſures of the world, or with the honours of the world, or with the cares of the world, or with the buſineſs of the world, is a heart incapacitated to receive any divine counſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Are there no burnt Citizens that are very angry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and impatient when they meet with oppoſition, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or procraſtination in their earneſt purſuing after the things of the world. <hi>Balaam</hi> was ſo intent and mad upon the world, that he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly, Are there no burnt Citizens, who are grown <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> cold, very cold, yea, even ſtark cold in their purſuit after God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, and holineſs, who once were for taking the Kingdom of Heaven by violence, who were <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 12.

            <p>Ninthly, Are there no burnt Citizens, who to gain the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> world, do very eaſily and frequently fall down before the temptations of the world? And what dos this ſpeak out, but their inordinate love to the world. That man who is as <note place="margin">Numb. 22. 15. to 23. Joſh. 7. 20, 21, 22.

            <p>Firſt, That the ſhorteſt, ſureſt and ſafeſt way to be rich, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be content with your preſent portion. The Philoſopher <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 12.</note> could ſay, <hi>He that is content wants nothing; and he that wants content, enjoyes nothing.</hi>

               </gap>condly, He who is contented with a little, will never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be ſatisfied with much: he who is not content with pounds <note place="margin">Much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not a Miſers mouth, ſaith the Proverb.</note> will never be ſatisfied with hundreds; and he who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a few hundreds, will never be ſatisfied with many thouſands. Eccleſ. 5. 10. <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſilver; nor be that loveth abundance with increaſe.</hi> Money of it ſelf cannot ſatisfie any deſire of Nature. If a man be hungry, it cannot feed him; if naked, it cannot clothe him; if cold, it cannot warm him; if ſick, it cannot
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40825:198"/> recover him. A circle cannot fill a triangle, no more can the whole world fill the heart of man. A man may as ſoon fill a Cheſt with Grace, as an heart with wealth. The ſoul of man may be buſied about earthly things, but it can never be filled, nor ſatisfied with earthly things. Air ſhall as ſoon fill the body, as money ſhall ſatisfie the mind. There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a worldling, who hath enough of the world to ſink him, who will never have enough of the world to ſatisfie him. The more an hydropical man drinketh, the more he thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. So the more money is encreaſed, the more the love of money is encreaſed; and the more the love of mony is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the more the ſoul is unſatisfied. 'Tis only an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, and an infinite good, that can fill and ſatisfie the <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 1.</note> precious and immortal ſoul of man. Look as nothing fits the ear but ſounds, and as nothing fits the ſmell but odours, ſo nothing fits the ſoul but God. Nothing below the great God can fit and fill animmortal ſoul. Nothing can content the ſoul of man but the fruition of God. God never reſted till he <note place="margin">Nature hath taught all men to ſeek after a <hi>ſummum bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> made man; and man can never reſt, till he enjoyes his God. Every man has a ſoul within him of a vaſt capacity, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can fill it to the brim, but he thats fulneſs it ſelf. Should we knock at every creatures door for happineſs, they would all anſwer us round, that it is not in them. The man in <hi>Plutarch</hi> that heard the Philoſophers wrangle about <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum;</hi> one placing of it in this, and another in that, went to the Market and bought up all that was good, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among all he ſhould not miſs of happineſs; and yet he miſt of it. The ſoul of man is of ſo glorious a make, that nothing below him that made it, can ſatisfie it. The ſumm of all that the creatures amount to according to <hi>Solomons</hi> reckoning, is vanity and vexation of Spirit. Vanity and vexation is the very quinteſcence of the creature, and all that can poſſibly be extracted out of it. Now if vanity can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, or if vexation can give content; if you can gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles, than go on and dote upon the world ſtill; and be alwayes enamoured with a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of periſhing beauty. <hi>Oramuzes</hi> the Enchanter boaſted, that in his Egg all the happineſs in the world was included,

            <p>Thirdly, 'Tis infinitely better to have much of God, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt, of the Spirit, of Holineſs, and of Heaven in our hearts with a little of the world in our hands, than to have much <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 10.</note> of the world in our hands, and but a little of God and Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo a little that a righteous man hath, is better than the abundance of the wicked: Is better than the riches of many wicked. <hi>Hamon</hi> which is the word here uſed, is from <hi>Hamah</hi> which ſignifies multitude of riches, or great plenty, or ſtore of riches: from this Hebrew word <hi>Hamon,</hi> Riches are called Mammon.

            <p n="1">1. Here is the righteous mans portion, and the wicked mans portion as to this world; the righteous man hath but little, the wicked has much.</p>

               </gap>o this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> than wicked men have to their multitude of riches. The righteous man holds his Tenure, by vertue of his marriage union with Chriſt, who is the heir of all things. We had an <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> equal right in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to all the good things of this world; but in his fall, we loſt our original right to the good things of this world. But now the righteous man by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> has recovered his right to all he enjoyes. Rom 8. 32. <hi>How ſhall he not with him a ſo freely give us all things?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 21. <hi>All things are yours.</hi> v. 22. <hi>Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the world, or life, or death, or things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or things to come, all are yours.</hi> But how come they to be intereſted in this large Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>every beaſt of the field be ours?</hi> So being married to Chriſt, and become one with him, all comes to be ours, through him who is the heir of all. By vertue of our marriage union with Chriſt, our title to the creatures is not only reſtored, but ſtrengthened. That little we have, is entailed upon us by Chriſt, in a more firm and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter way than ever. In the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> our Tenure was lower, and meaner, and baſer, and uncertainer, than now it is: for our Title, our Tenure by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40825:200"/> Chriſt is more honourable, and ſtronger, and ſweeter, and laſtinger, than ever it was before. For now we hold all we have <hi>in Capite,</hi> Chriſt is our head, and husband, and by him we hold all we have. But now wicked men by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> have loſt their Original Patent and Charter which once they had to ſhew for the things of this life. By <hi>Adams</hi> fall they have forfeited Gods primitive donation of all right in the creatures, every wicked man in the world has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his right to the creatures in <hi>Adam,</hi> and lies under that forfeiture. But to the glory of divine patience be it ſpoken, God has not ſued out his forfeiture, God has not brought a Writ of ejection againſt him; and by this means he comes to be lawfully poſſeſſed of thoſe earthly bleſſings he dos en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. As a Fellon though he hath forfeited his life and eſtate to the Kings Juſtice, and is ſtill ſubject to ejection at the Kings pleaſure, yet while the King forbears him, his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is good and lawful, and no man may diſturb him.

            <p n="1">1. That the ſillieſt and ſimpleſt being wronged, may juſtly ſpeak in their own defence.</p>

               </gap>ter than a wicked mans millions. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That little a righteous man hath, he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ough the Covenant, and through precious promiſes. Now <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> a little mercy reacht out to a man through the Covenant, and as a fruit of the promiſe, is more worth, than a world of bleſſings, that flow in upon a man meerly by a gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. There are no mercies ſo ſweet, ſo ſure, ſo firm, ſo laſting, as thoſe that flow in upon us through the Covenant of Grace. O this ſweetens every drop, and ſip, and cruſt, and crum of mercy that a godly man enjoyes. All the paths <note place="margin">Pſalm 25. 10.</note> of the Lord are mercy and truth, to ſuch as keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. This is a ſweet promiſe, a precious promiſe, a ſoul ſatisfying promiſe, a promiſe more worth than all the riches of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Mark, all the paths of the Lord to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are not only mercy, but they are mercy and truth; that <note place="margin">Conſult theſe Scriptures, Joſh. 23. 14, 15. 1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> is, they are ſure mercies that ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>am in upon them through the Covenant. Well Sirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt remember this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the leaſt mercy, the leaſt bleſſing flowing in upon us through the promiſe, is more worth than a thouſand bleſſings that flow in upon us from a general Providence: the leaſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing flowing in upon us through the Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt, is better than ten thouſand Talents, that are the meer products of a general Providence. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Such as enjoy all they have, only from a general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they enjoy their mercies from that common ſource or <note place="margin">Pſalm 145. 15, 16.</note> pring that feeds the Birds of the Air, and the beaſts of the Field. The ſame common bounty of God that feeds and clothes the wicked, feeds the Birds and Beaſts that periſh. But,</p>
            <pb n="201" facs="tcp:40825:201"/>
            <p> Secondly, There is no certainty of the continuance of ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> mercies that are only the product of a common Providence. <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 16.</note> But now the mercies that flow in upon the Saints through the Covenant of Grace, they ſhall be ſure to us, ſo long as the <note place="margin">Chap. 55. 3.</note> continuance of them may be for our good and Gods glory. Now the leaſt mercies held by Covenant, are infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the greateſt riches in the world that only drop up on us out of the hand of a common Providence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Righteous man hath his little from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> love and favour of God. All his little flowes in upon <note place="margin">Pſal. 146. 8. Prov. 15. 17.</note> him from that very ſame love which moved the Lord to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow Chriſt upon him. All the righteous mans little is from the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh: his little comes <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 16.</note> from a reconciled God, as well as a bountiful God: from a tender Father, as well as a merciful Creator. A Dinner of <note place="margin">Dan. 1. 12.</note> green Hearbs, <hi>Daniels</hi> Pulſe, Barley Loaves, a few Fiſhes, yea, <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſcraps, cruſts and raggs, and <hi>Johns</hi> Garment of Camels hair, from reconciled love, is infinitely better than all the riches and dainties of the wicked, which are all mixed and mingled with croſſes and curſes. All the mercies and <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 33. Mal. 2. 2. Pſal. 78. 30, 31.</note> abundance that wicked men have, is in wrath, and from wrath: there is wrath in every cup they drink in, and in every diſh they eat in, and in every bed they lye on, and in every ſtool they ſit on. But the little the righteous man hath, flowes from the ſweeteſt ſprings of divine love: ſo that they may well ſay as <hi>Gideon</hi> did. <hi>The gleanings of the Grapes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judges 8. 2.</note> 
               <hi>of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>is it not better than the Vintage of Abiezer.</hi> The very gleanings of the righteous are better than the greateſt Vintages of the wicked. The abundance of the wicked ſtill flowes in upon them from the bitter ſtreams of Divine Wrath. A little water flowing from a ſweet ſpring, is much better, than a great deal that flowes from the ſalt Sea. The loving kindneſs of God dos raiſe the leaſt eſtate above the greateſt eſtate in the world: yea, it raiſeth it above life it ſelf (or lives <hi>Chajim)</hi> which is the beſt of all temporal <note place="margin">Pſalm 63. 3.</note> bleſſings. Ten pound given by a King out of favour and reſpect, is a better gift, than a thouſand given in wrath and diſpleaſure. But,</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:40825:202"/>
            <p> Fourthly, The little that the righteous man hath is bleſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and ſanctified to him; as you may ſee by comparing the <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 8, 9. Pſalm 3. 8. Gen. 22. 17. Chap. 26. 12. Prov. 10. 22. Deut. 28. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Prov. 3. 33. Mal. 2. 2.</note> Scriptures in the Margent together. A little bleſt unto a man, is better than all the world curſt. Now all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and mercies that the wicked do enjoy, though they are matetially bleſſings, yet they are formally curſes: as all the croſſes that befalls a righteous man, though they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially croſſes, yet they are formally bleſſings. The habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, relations, honors, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the wicked are all cruſt unto them. There is poyſon in every cup the wicked man drinks, and ſnares in every diſh he puts his fingers in, the Plague in all the clothes he wears, and a curſe upon the houſe in which he dwells. Zech. 5. 3, 4. <hi>Then he ſaid unto me, this is the curſe that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that ſtealeth, ſhall be cut off as on this ſide, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and every one that ſweareth, ſhall be cut off, as on that ſide, according to it. I will bring it forth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and it ſhall enter into the houſe of the Thief, and into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by my Name; and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it, with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof.</hi> So Job 24. 18. <hi>Their portion is curſed in the earth.</hi> A fat purſe and a fat heart, a whole eſtate and a whole heart, a fat body and a lean ſoul. Pſal. 106. 15. <hi>He ſent leanneſs into their ſouls.</hi> All the bleſſings of the wicked have their but. As the Cup in <hi>Benjamins</hi> Sack, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſnare to him, rather than a mercy. O the curſes and vexations that attend all the bleſſings of the wicked! It may be ſaid of the little that a righteous man hath, as it was once ſaid of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Garment, <hi>It is like a field which the Lord hath bleſſed. He bleſſeth the habitations of the juſt. Eſau</hi> had <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 33.</note> a fair eſtate left him, and <hi>Jacob</hi> a leſs, yet <hi>Jacobs</hi> was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate than <hi>Eſau's,</hi> becauſe his little was bleſt to him, when <hi>Eſau's</hi> much was curſt to him. One little draught of clear wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, is better than a Sea of brackiſh ſalt water. The application is eaſie. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, A little improved and well husbanded, is better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5,"/> than a great deal that is either not improved, or but ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Every eſtate is as 'tis improved: a little Farm well
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40825:202"/> improved, is much better than a great Farm, that is either not improved, or ill improved. A little money, a little ſtock in a Shop well improved, is better than a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, a great ſtock, that is either not improved, or ill improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now here give me leave to ſhew you briefly how a godly man improves his little. Take me thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A godly man improves his little to the ſtirring up of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his beart to thankfulneſs, and to be much in admiring and <note place="margin">Pſalm 103. 1, 2, 3. Pſalm 116. 12, 13.</note> bleſſing of God for a little. Every drop the Dove drinks, he lifts up his head to Heaven. Every Bird in his kind (ſaith <hi>Ambroſe)</hi> doth chirp forth thankfulneſs to his Maker. So the righteous man will bleſs God much for a little; yea, he will bleſs God very much for a very little. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, A righteous man improves his little to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and abaſing of himſelf before the Lord, as one that is <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 18.</note> much below the leaſt of mercies, Gen. 32. 10. <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt of all the mercies which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi> A righteous man labours to have his heart lye low under the ſenſe of the leaſt ſin, and under the ſmart of the leaſt rod, and under the ſight of the leaſt mercy. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A righteous man improves his little to the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and fencing of himſelf againſt ſinful temptations. Little <note place="margin">Gen. 39. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> mercies are many times great arguments to keep a gracious ſoul from ſin. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A righteous man improves his little to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and refreſhing of the bowels of others that are in want, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 6. 10.</note> and whoſe pinching neceſſities call for ſupplyes. A poor man begging at a Chriſtians door who was very poor, he ſpoke to his Wife to give him ſomething; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe had but three-pence in the houſe: ſaith he, give him that, for if we never ſow, we ſhall never reap. There was another Chriſtian, who having given a little of his little to a man, began to think whether he had injured himſelf; but preſently he corrected himſelf with theſe thoughts, that he had lent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> one, that would pay all again with advantage with intereſt upon intereſt: within an hour after he had it reſtored above ſeven-fold, in a way which he never thought of The <hi>Italian</hi> form of begging is, <hi>Do good for your ſelves.</hi> But,</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:40825:203"/>
            <p> Fifthly, A righteous man improves his little to the ſtirring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> up and provoking of his own heart to look after better and greater mercies, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpiritual and eternal favours. O ſaith the righteous man, if there be ſo much ſweetneſs in a few drops, and ſips, and ſmall draughts, and cruſts, and ſcraps? <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. ult. Joh. 4. 10, 11. 14. Chap. 6. 4. Rev. 19. 8.</note> What is in thoſe everlaſting ſprings of pleaſure and delight, that be at Gods right hand? If there be ſo much pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a piece of bread, and ſo much warmth in a courſe Suit of clothes, what ſweetneſs is there in the waters of life? and what pleaſantneſs is there in that bread of life that came down from Heaven? and what warmth is there in that fine Linnen that is the righteouſneſs of the Saints? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man looks upon his leaſt temporals, to be a ſtrong engagement upon him, to ſeek after eternals. But now <note place="margin">Matth: 25.</note> wicked men are ſo far from improving their much, their riches, their great riches, that they either hide their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, as that evil ſervant did his; or elſe they prove Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to their mercies; and make them ſervants to their luſts, as pride, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Compare theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures together, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 1.-10. <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 1.-7. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>James</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The few mercies, the leaſt mercies that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> man hath, are pledges, and pawns, and an earneſt of more mercies, of better mercies, and of greater mercies, than any yet they do enjoy. Now a farthing given as an earneſt of a thouſand a year, is better than many pounds given as a preſent reward. Wicked men have outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as their portion, their Heaven, their all. <hi>Son remember</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſalm 17. 14. Luke 16. 25.</note> 
               <hi>that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things.</hi> But now that little that a godly man hath, he has it as a pledge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and as an earneſt of eternal favours and mercies. The little mercies the Saints enjoy, are doors of hope, to let in greater and better mercies: thoſe mercies a righteous man has, are but in-lets to further mercies. When <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>el</hi> had a Son, ſhe called his name <hi>Joſeph, ſaying, the Lord ſhall add to me another Son.</hi> Every mercy that a righteous man enjoyes <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 24.</note> may well be called <hi>Joſeph,</hi> becauſe 'tis a certain pledge of ſome
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40825:203"/> further and greater mercy that is to be added to thoſe the righteous man already enjoyes. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The righteous man enjoyes his little with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> great deal of comfort, peace, quiet and contentment: the righteous man with his little, ſits <hi>Noah</hi> like quiet and ſtill <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12, 13.</note> in the midſt of all the hurries, diſtractions, combuſtions and confuſions that be in the world. Though the righteous <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 22. Chap. 15. 16, 17.</note> man has but from hand to mouth, yet ſeeing that God feeds him from Heaven as it were with Manna, he is quiet and cheerful: but now wicked men have abundance of vexation with their worldly abundance: as you ſee in <hi>Haman,</hi> Eſther 5. 9, 11, 12. 13. <hi>Then went</hi> Haman <hi>forth that day joyfully and with a glad heart. But when</hi> Haman <hi>ſaw</hi> Mordicai <hi>in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">If I had an enemy, ſaith <hi>Lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mer,</hi> to whom I might lawfully wiſh evil, I would chiefly wiſh him great ſtore of riches; for then he ſhould never enjoy quiet.</note> 
               <hi>Kings gate, that he ſtood not up nor moved for him, he was full of indignation againſt</hi> Mordicai. <hi>And</hi> Haman <hi>told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him above the Princes and ſervants of the King.</hi> Haman <hi>ſaid moreover, yea,</hi> Eſther <hi>the Queen did let no man come in with the King unto the Banquet that ſhe had prepared, but my ſelf; and to morrow am I invited unto her alſo with the King. Yet all this availeth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee</hi> Mordicai <hi>the Jew ſitting at the Kings gate.</hi> It is ſeldom ſeen, that God allows unto the greateſt darlings of the world a perfect content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Something they muſt have to complain of, that ſhall give an unſavoury verdure to their ſweeteſt morſels, and make their felicity miſerable. It was not ſimply <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicais</hi> ſitting at the Kings gate, but <hi>Mordicais</hi> refuſing to ſtand up, or to move either Hat, head, or hand, or to bow any part of his body, that dampt all <hi>Hamans</hi> joy, and that filled him with rage and vexation of ſpirit. The want of little things, <hi>viz.</hi> a knee, a hat, will exceedingly vex and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an ambitious ſpirit. So <hi>Ahab,</hi> though a King, yet when he was ſick for <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, his heart did more afflict and vex it ſelf with greedy longing for that bit of <note place="margin">1 Kings 21. 4.</note>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e things of this world. Riches are compared to thorns: and indeed all the comforts the wicked enjoy, they have more or leſs of the thorn in them. And indeed riches may well be called thorns; becauſe they pierce both head and heart: the one with care of getting, and the other with grief in parting with them. The world and all the glory thereof, is like a beautiful Harlot: a Paradiſe to the eye, but a Purgatory to the ſoul. A wicked man under all his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Enjoyes not the peace of his conſcience upon any juſt or ſolid grounds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He enjoyes not the peace of contentment upon any ſober or righteous grounds. But now a righteous man with his little, enjoyes both peace of conſcience, and peace of contentment; and this makes every better ſweet, and every little ſweet to be exceeding ſweet. A diſh of green Hearbs with peace of conſcience, and peace of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a noble feaſt, a continual feaſt to a gracious ſoul. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, the righteous man ſees God, and acknowledges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> God, and enjoyes God in his little. Look, as he that can't <note place="margin">Job. 1. 21. Gen. 27. 28. Chap. 33. 10, 11.</note> ſee God in the leaſt affliction, in the leaſt judgement, will never be truly humbled; ſo he that can't ſee God in the leaſt mercy, will never be truly thankful, nor cheerful in every

               </gap>ip of mercy that a righteous man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes, he ſees much of the love of his God, and the care of his God, and the wiſdom of his God, and the power of his God, and the faithfulneſs of his God, and the goodneſs of his God, in making the leaſt proviſion for him. I have read of the Jews, how that when they read the little Book of <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,</hi> they let fall the Book on the ground, and they give this reaſon for that Ceremony, <hi>becauſe the name of God is not to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that mercy drop out of his hand, out of his mouth wherein he can't read his God, and ſee his God, and taſte his God, and enjoy his God. But now wicked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n may ſay, as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> did in another caſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here is the mantle of</hi> Elijah, <hi>but where is the God of</hi> Elijah? <note place="margin">2 Kings 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Here is abundance of riches, and honours, and dignities, &amp;c. but where is the God of all theſe comforts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, they mind not God, they ſee not God, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not God in all they have, in all they enjoy: as you may ſee, by comparing the Scriptures in the Margent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 5, 8, 9. Iſa. 1. 3, 4. Jer. 2. 6. Eſther 5. 10, 11, 12. Luke 12. 19.</note> Wicked men are like the Horſe and the Mule, that drinks of the brook, but never think of the ſpring. They are like to the Swine that eats up the Maſt, but never looks to the Tree from whence the Maſt falls. They are like ſuch barren ground, that ſwallows up the ſeed, but returns nothing to the ſower. A dunghill ſpirited fellow in our dayes being by a neighbour excited to bleſs God for a rich crop of Corn he had ſtanding on his ground; Atheiſtically replyed, <hi>Thank God! Nay rather thank my Dung-Cart!</hi> I have read of a great Cardinal, who writing down in his Diary, what ſuch a Lord did for him, and how far ſuch a Prince favoured him, and what encouragement he had from ſuch a King; and how ſuch a Pope preferred him, but not one word of God in all. One reading of it, took his Pen and wrote underneath, here God did nothing. But,</p>
            <p>Ninthly, The little the righteous man hath, is enough: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> enough to ſatisfie him, enough to content him, enough to <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 1, 2.

Though it be true, that nothing will ſatisfie a wicked mans luſts; yet 'tis as true, that a little will ſatisfie nature, and leſs will ſatisfie Grace. <hi>Jacob</hi> vows, that the Lord ſhould be his God, if he would but give him bread to eat, and rayment to put on. This was the firſt holy Vow that ever we read of; Hence <hi>Jacob</hi> is called the Father of Vows. He begs not <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20, 21.</note> dainties to ſeed him, nor Silks, nor Sattins to clothe him; but bread to feed him, though never ſo courſe, and clothes to cover him, though never ſo mean. <hi>Job</hi> is only for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary food. A little will ſatisfie a temperate Chriſtian. <hi>Luther</hi> made many a meal of Bread and a Red Herring; and <note place="margin">Job 23. 12.

They are like thoſe four things that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, that are never ſatisfied, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grave, the barren Womb, the <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 15, 16.

God himſelf is the only centre of centers, and as the ſoul can never reſt, till it return to him (as the Dove <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 9. The poor Heathen could ſay, I deſire neither more nor leſs than enough.

'Tis not the Golden Crown that can cure the head-ache, nor the Velvet Slipper that can caſe a man of the Gout, nor the Purple Robe that can fray away a burning Feaver.

And as our ſpiritual life conſiſts not in any of theſe earthly things, ſo our eternal life conſiſts not in any of theſe earthly things: for as all the treaſures of this world can't bring a ſoul to Heaven, ſo they cannot keep a ſoul from dropping down to Hell.</p>

O with what a diſdainful eye, with what a contemptible eye, with what a ſcornful eye, and with what a weaned heart and cold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do men look upon all the pomp, ſtate, bravery and glory of the world, when their ſoul ſits upon their trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling lips, and there is but a ſhort ſtep between them and eternity.

            <p n="4">4. He will never dote upon the world, he will never be enamoured with the world. I have read of a man, who ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a burning Feaver, profeſt that if he had all the world at his diſpoſe, he would give it all for one draught of Beer, at ſo low a rate do men value the world at ſuch a time as that is.

If men were but ſo wiſe to value the world at no higher a rate in health, than they do in ſickneſs; in the day of life, than they do at the hour of death; they would never be fond of it, they would never be ſo deeply in love with it.

As a <note place="margin">As Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> the Martyr, ſaid, I deſire theſe earthly things, ſo far as they may be helps to the keeping of thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> paſſenger when he comes to a deep River, deſires a Boat, but not for the Boats ſake, but that he may paſs over the River, for could he paſs over the River without a Boat, he would never cry out, a Boat, a Boat: or as the Traveller deſires his Inn, not for the Inns ſake, but as it is a help, a furtherance to him in his journey homewards; or as the Patient deſires Phyſick, not for Phyſick ſake, but in order to his health. So a Chriſtian may lawfully deſire earthly things in order to his glorifying of God; and as they may be a help to him in his Chriſtian courſe, and a furtherance to him in his heavenly race, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may deſire earthly things in ſubordination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the will of God. Lord if it be thy pleaſure, give me this and that earthly comfort, yet not my will, but thy will be done. Lord thou art the wiſe Phyſitian of bodies, ſouls and Nations, if it may ſtand with thy glory, give thy ſick Patient life, health and ſtrength; yet not my will, but thy will be done. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may deſire ſuch a meaſure of earthly things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and ſuch a number of earthly things, as may be ſuitable to the <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8, 9. 1 Tim. 6. 8.</note> place, calling relation and condition wherein the Providence of God has ſet us.

               </gap>ſter, the Child than the Father, the Peſant than the Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The too eager purſuit of moſt men after the things of this world to make up the loſſes that they ſuſtained by the fire, hath been the true cauſe, why I have inſiſted ſo largely upon this ninth Duty that we are to learn by that fiery diſpenſation that hath paſt upon us.</p>
            <p>The tenth Duty that lyes upon thoſe who have been <note place="margin">10.</note> burnt up, is to be very importunate with God, to take away thoſe ſins that have laid our City deſolate, and to keep off from ſin for the time to come, and to look narrowly to your ſpirits, that you do not charge the Lord fooliſhly, becauſe he <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> has brought you under his fiery rod. Job 1. 16. <hi>While he was yet ſpeaking, there came alſo another and ſaid, the fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burnt up the ſheep, and the ſervants, and conſumed them, and I only am eſcaped alone to tell thee.</hi> v. 22. <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> The fire of God (that is, a great, fierce and terrible fire) that fell from Heaven, and conſumed <hi>Jobs</hi> ſheep and ſervants, was a more terrible Judgement, than all the former Judgements that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them, becauſe God ſeemed to fight againſt <hi>Job</hi> with his own bare hand, by fire from Heaven, as once he did againſt <hi>Sodom: In all this Job ſinned not:</hi> that is, in all this that <hi>Job</hi> ſuffered, acted and uttered, there was not any thing that was materially ſinful. Satan he ſaid, that if God would but touch all that he had, <hi>Job</hi> would curſe him to his face; but when it came to the proof, there was no ſuch thing. For <hi>Job</hi> had a fair and full victory over him, and Satan was proved a loud lyar. For <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not in thought, word or deed: <hi>Job</hi> did neither ſpeak, nor do any thing that was diſhonourable to God, or a reproach to his Religion, or a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40825:210"/> wound to his conſcience: under this fiery tryal <hi>Job</hi> did not ſo much as entertain one hard thought concerning God: nor let fall one hard word concerning God, under all the evils that befell <hi>Job. Job</hi> ſtill thinks well of God, and ſpeaks well of God, and carries it well towards God: Certainly <hi>Job</hi> had a great deal of God within him, which kept him from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under ſuch great and grievous ſufferings. O Sirs, it is a far greater mercy to be kept from ſinnings under our ſufferings, than it is to be delivered from the greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. <hi>Jobs</hi> heart was ſo well ſeaſoned with Grace, that he would admit of no inſolent or unfavoury thoughts of God, or of his ſevereſt Providences. <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly,</hi> or <hi>with folly.</hi> Some refer the former part of this Verſe to the mind, and the latter to the mouth: ſhewing that <hi>Job</hi> (though he had loſt all) neither thought in his heart, nor uttered with his mouth any thing unmeet and unworthy of God.

               </gap>haviour of <hi>Job</hi> under all his ſore loſſes and croſſes, is here owned, renowned, crowned and chronicled by God himſelf. O Sirs, ſinning is worſe than ſuffering; it is better to ſee a people bleeding, than blaſpheming; burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than curſing; for by mens ſins God is diſhonoured, but by their ſufferings God is glorified.

Aſſuredly every gracious heart had rather be rid of his ſins, than of his ſufferings, Job 7. 21. <hi>And why doſt thou not take away mine iniquity,</hi> or <hi>lift up,</hi> as the Hebrew runs, to note, that though <hi>Job</hi> had many loads, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny burthens upon him, yet none lay ſo heavy upon him, as his ſin, Hoſ. 14. 2. <hi>Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> 'Tis not take away our captivity, and receive us graciouſly; but take away our iniquity, and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciouſly: nor it is not take away this or that particular ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and receive us graciouſly, but take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly; take away ſtain and ſting, crime and curſe, power and puniſhment, that we may never hear more of it, nor never feel more of it: nor never be troubled any more with it. Though their bondage was great, very <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 11, 12, 13.</note> great, yea, greater than any people under Heaven were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with, yet their ſins were a more unſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to their ſpirits, than their bondage was.

            <p>The twelfth Duty that lyes upon thoſe who have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> burnt up, is to ſecure the everlaſting welfare of their precious and immortal ſouls. O Sirs, <hi>Londons</hi> Aſhes tell you to your faces, that you cannot ſecure your Houſes, your Shops, your
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40825:212"/> Eſtates, your Trades, but the eternal well being of your ſouls may be ſecured. Every burnt Citizen carries a Jewel, a Pearl of price, a rich Treaſure about him; <hi>viz.</hi> a Divine <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 26.</note> ſoul, which is more worth than all the world. As Chriſt who only went to the price of ſouls, as told us, There is <note place="margin">Pſalm 19. 1, 2.</note> much of the Power, Wiſdom, Majeſty and Glory of God ſtampt upon the ſtately fabrick of this world, but there is more of the Power, Wiſdom, Majeſty and Glory of God ſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an immortal ſoul. The ſoul is the glory of the Creation. What <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of Wiſdom, is very applicable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">Job 28. 13, 16, 17.</note> ſoul of man. Man knows not the price thereof: It cannot be valued with the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> with the precious Onyx, or the Sapphire. The Gold and the Chryſtal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it, ſhall not be for Jewels of fine Gold. The ſoul is a beam of God, a heavenly ſpark, a coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial plant; it is the beauty of man, the wonder of Angels, <note place="margin">Pſalm 45. 13. <hi>Epictetus</hi> and many others of the more refined Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have long ſince ſaid that the body was but the Organ, the ſoul was the man, the Merchandize.</note> the envy of Devils, and the glory of God. O how richly and gloriouſly hath God embroydered the ſoul. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought Gold.</hi> The ſoul is divinely inlaid and enamel'd by Gods own hand. The ſoul is of an Angelical nature, it is of a divine Offſpring, it is a ſpiritual ſubſtance capable of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of union with God, and of communion with God, and of an eternal fruition of God. The ſoul is an immortal ſubſtance, and that not only <hi>per gratiam,</hi> by the grace and favour of God, as the body of <hi>Adam</hi> was in the ſtate of innocency, and as the bodies of Saints ſhall be at the reſurrection, but <hi>per naturam,</hi> by its own nature, having no internal principle of corruption, ſo as it cannot by any thing from within it ſelf ceaſe to be; neither can it be annihilated by any thing from without. <hi>Fear not them which kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 28.</note> 
               <hi>but are not able to kill the ſoul.</hi> Some have obſerved to my hand, that there are three ſorts of created ſpirits: the firſt of <note place="margin">Gregory, &amp;c.</note> thoſe whoſe dwellings is not with with fleſh, or in fleſhly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they are the Angels: the ſecond, of thoſe which are wholly immerſed in fleſh, the ſouls of beaſts, which riſe out of the power of the fleſh, and periſh together with it: the third is of thoſe which inhabit bodies of fleſh, but riſe out of

If you ſave your ſouls, though you ſhould loſe all you have in this world, your loſs would be a gainful loſs; but if you loſe your precious ſouls, though you ſhould gain all the world, yet your very gains will undo you for ever. You have found by the late dreadful fire, that there is no ſecuring of the things of this world; and therefore make it your buſineſs, your work, to get a Chriſt for your ſouls, grace for your ſouls, and a Heaven for your ſouls, that ſo though all go to wrack h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The thirteenth duty that is incumbent upon thoſe who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> have been burnt up, is to get a God for their portion.

If the loſs of your earthly portions ſhall be ſo ſanctified to you, as to work you to make God your portion, then your unſpeakable loſſes will prove inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gain unto you. O Sirs, God is the moſt abſolute need ful and neceſſary portion: the want or the loſs of earthly portions may afflict and trouble you, but the want of God for your portion will certainly damn you: it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, that you ſhould have a portion in Gold, or Silver, or Jewels, or Goods, or Houſes, or Lands, or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips; but it is abſolutely neceſſary, that you ſhould have God for your portion. Suppoſe that with the Apoſtles, you have no certain dwelling place, nor no Gold, nor Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 11. Acts 3. 6.

However it may go with you in this world, yet you ſhall be ſure to be glorious in that other world. To have God for thy portion O man, is the one thing neceſſary; for without it thou art for ever and ever undone: If God be not thy portion, thou canſt never enjoy communion with God in this world: if God be not thy portion, thou canſt never be ſaved by him in the other world.

               </gap>leſs: God was both their hiding place and their dwelling place. He that dwelleth in God, cannot be unhouſed, becauſe God is ſtronger than all. 'Tis brave for a Chriſtian to take up in God as in his Manſion-houſe. It was a witty ſaying of that learned man <hi>Picus Mirandula, viz.</hi> That God created
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40825:214"/> the earth for Beaſts ro inhabit, the Sea for Fiſhes, the Air for Fowls, the Heavens for Angels and Stars; and therefore man hath no place to dwell and abide in, but God alone. Now the great God has burnt up your dwelling places, make him your dwelling place, your habitation, your ſhelter, your place of retreat, your City of refuge. Certainly they dwell moſt ſafely, moſt ſecurely, moſt nobly, moſt contentedly, moſt delightfully and moſt happily, who dwell in God, who live under the wing of God, and whoſe conſtant abode, is under the ſhadow of the Almighty. Let the loſs of your habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lead you by the hand, to make choice of God for your habitation. There is no ſecurity againſt temporal, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eternal judgements, but by making God your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place. How deplorable is the condition of that man that hath neither a houſe to dwell in, nor a God to dwell in? that can naither ſay, this houſe is mine, nor this God is mine? that hath neither a houſe made with hands, nor yet <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1, 2. 1 John 4. 13. Chap. 3. 24.</note> one eternal in the Heavens. 'Tis a very great mercy for God to dwell with us, but it is a far greater mercy, for God to dwell in us, and for we to dwell in God. For God to dwell with us, argues much happineſs, but for we to dwell in God, this argues more happineſs, yea, the top of happineſs. There is no ſtudy, no care, no wiſdom, no prudence, no underſtanding, to that which works men to make God their habitation. No ſtorms, no tempeſts, no afflictions, no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, no Judgements can reach that man, or hurt that man, who has made God his dwelling place. He that hath God for his habitation, can never be miſerable; and he that hath not God for his habitation, can never be happy.

            <p>Secondly, A City is compact, it is made up of many habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo in Heaven there are many habitations, many <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 2.</note> Manſions.

            <p>Not doing thine own wayes, that is, works: not ſpeaking thine own words: not finding thine own pleaſure. Now mark, we have ſtronger reaſons to engage us to a ſtricter obſervation and ſanctification of the Lords Day, than they had for their Sabbath: which may be thus evinced.</p>
            <p>(Not to ſpeak of their double Sacrifices upon their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, Our Motives are far greater, and more efficacious: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our day hath many priviledges above theirs: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               </gap>tles given to it by holy and learned men. As the Queen of dayes, Princeſs, Principal, Primate, a Royal day, higher than the higheſt, the firſt fruits of the days; yea, ſaith <hi>Hierom,</hi> The Lords Day is better than any other common day, than all Feſtivals, New-moons, and Sabbaths of <hi>Moſes.</hi> By theſe Titles 'tis evident, that the Ancients had the Lords Day in very h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh eſteem and veneration. Sirs, look, what Gold is among inferiour Mettals, and what among other Grain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame is the Lords Day above all other dayes of the week.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their Sabbath was celebrated for the memorial of the Creation; ours for the great work of Redemption. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Theirs was celebrated for their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ours for our deliverance from Hell. Now if the Jews were bound, and that for a whole day not to do their own works, nor ſpeak their own words, nor find their own pleaſure; how much more ſolemnity belongs to our Lords Day? O, what a day is the Lords Day! and how ſolemnly and devoutly ought it to be obſerved and ſanctified? But,</p>
            <p>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>condly, We have greater means and helps for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Sabbath, than the Jews had for a long time; or than the Primitive Chriſtians had for three hundred years. Mark, the holy obſervation of the Sabbath among them, came in by degrees long after the day was ſettled; and the reaſon was this, becauſe for a good while they had no word written to be read, nor no Synagogues built to read it in. It was well nigh a thouſand years, or above a thouſand years after the giving of the Law, before the reading of the Law in Synagogues came up. For a long time they had no Books among them, but the five Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and thoſe Books neither, were not well underſtood by the common people. And it is further obſervable, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being in <hi>Aegypt</hi> under ſore preſſures, afflictions and cruel bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither did, nor could keep the Sabbath in any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, not being permitted either to reſt, or enjoy any ſolemn aſſemblies. And when they were in their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs condition, they had many ſtations, diverſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40825:218"/> of enemies, ſo that they could not keep the Sabbath in any ſolemn publick manner, as afterwards they did when they were ſetled in peace and ſafety in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And ſo the Primitive Chriſtians for three hundred years live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r very great and violent Perſecutions: they neither did, nor could keep the Lords Day with that ſolemnity that they ſhould or would; but as for place, they met not openly, but ſecretly in Woods, and Deſarts, and Holes, and Caves, and Dens of the earth: and ſo for time, ſometimes they met in the day, and often they met in the night. But as for us, who have lived, and do live in theſe dayes of the Son of man, what rare means and helps, what abundance of means and helps, what choice and precious means and helps have we had, and ſtill have (in ſpite of all oppoſitions from high or low) to enable us to ſanctifie the Sabbath. And O that all the means and helps, that we yet enjoy, may be ſignally bleſt to that purpoſe. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Heathens by the very light of nature, held <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it but reaſonable, that the dayes conſecrated to their Gods, ſhould totally be obſerved with reſt, and ſanctity, the <hi>Flamins</hi> which were their Prieſts, affirmed, that the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes were polluted, if any work were done upon the ſolemn dayes; beſides it was not lawful for the King of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Macrob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Scaevòla</hi> the High Prieſt affirmed, that the wilful offendor could have no expiation. Now ſhall Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens be ſo ſtrict in the obſervation of their holy dayes, and ſhall not Chriſtians be as ſtrict in their obſervation of the Lords Day? Theſe Heathens will one day riſe in judgement againſt the ſlight obſervers, and the groſs prophaners of the Lords Day. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt ſanctifie the Sabbath, by preparing ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40825:219"/> Command, more than he hath upon any other Command. Exod. 20. 8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes are our Market-dayes. Now men that are world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe, they conſider before hand, what to buy, and what to ſell.

When the Temple was to be built, the Stones were hewen, and the Timber ſquared and fitted, before they were brought to the place where the Temple ſtood. The Application is eaſie.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Jews had their preparations, Mark 15. 42. <hi>And</hi>

               <hi>now when the Even was come,</hi> (becauſe it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Their preparation began at three a clock in the after-noon, which the Hebrews called the Sabbath Eve. The Jews (as I have read) were ſo careful in their preparation for the Sabbath, that to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, the beſt and wealthieſt of them, even thoſe that had many ſervants, and were Maſters of Families, would chop Hearbs, ſweep the houſe, cleave wood, and kindle the fire, and do ſuch like things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>condly, The Heathens did uſe to prepare themſelves by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a ſtrict kind of holineſs, before they would offer Sacrifices to ſeveral of their Gods. They had (as Authors write) their ſtone pots of water ſet at the doors of their Temples, where they uſed to waſh before they went to Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The works of the day are great and glorious: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and what excellent works are there in nature, but requires ſome previous preparation? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Firſt, In a holy care, ſo to order all our worldly buſineſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and affairs on the day before, that they may not encreaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us on the Lords Day, to trouble us, or diſtract us in the duties of that day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In putting iniquity far from you, in laying aſide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, that you may receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted <note place="margin">Job 11. 14, 15.

And ſo when the heart is filthy and unclean, it loſes all the good, it might otherwiſe gain by Ordinances. If the ſtomach be foul it muſt be purged before it be fed, or elſe the meat will never
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40825:220"/> nouriſh and ſtrengthen nature, but encreaſe ill humours. So the ſouls of men muſt be purged from ſoul enormities and groſs impieties, or elſe they will never gain any ſaving good by Ordinances. 2 Tim. 2. 21. <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified and meet for the Maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good work, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In acting your graces in all the duties of the day.

Look as the fire is encreaſed and preſerved by blowing; ſo are our graces preſerved and encreaſed by our acting of them. We get nothing by dead and uſeleſs habits: Talents hid in a Napkin, gather ruſt. Look, as the nobleſt facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are imbaſed, when they are not improved, when they are not exerciſed. So the nobleſt graces are imbaſed, when they are not improved, when they are not exerciſed. Grace is bettered and made more perfect, by acting: neglect of our graces, is the ground of their decreaſe and decay. Wells are the ſweeter for drawing: and ſo are our graces for acting.

It is more obſervable, that the Sabbaths and publick ſervice are joyned together. Lev. 19. 30. <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary, I am the Lord.</hi> Now what God hath <hi>ſolemnly joyned together, let no man put aſſunder.</hi> Every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould make it his great care, that private duties do not eat up publick Ordinances, and that publick Ordinances do not ſhut out private duties.

O Sirs, Sabbaths are the very ſuburbs of heaven: and who can be in the ſuburbs of heaven and not rejoyce? A beautiful face is at all times pleaſing to the eye; but then eſpecially when there is joy manifeſted in the countenance. Joy in the face puts a new beauty upon a perſon, and makes that which before was beautiful, to be exceeding beautiful; it puts a luſtre upon beauty. And ſo doth holy joy put a luſtre upon the day of God, the wayes of God, and the people of God. It is the duty and glory of a Chriſtian to rejoyce in the Lord every day, but eſpecially on the Lords Day: God reſerves the beſt wine, the beſt comforts, and the choiceſt diſcoveries of himſelf, and of his love, and of his Chriſt, and of his glory for that day, and all to make his people <hi>joyful in the houſe of</hi>

But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord this day, and to rejoyce in all the duties of this day, and to rejoyce in that redemption that was wrought for us on this day, this is to crown Chriſt, this is to lift up Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, You muſt ſanctifie the Sabbath, by ſanctifying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> of the whole day to Gods ſervice; and not by fits, and flaſhes, and ſudden pangs. O Sirs, if the Lord was ſo ſtrict that he would not loſe a moments honor in a ceremonial day of reſt. (Lev. 23. 32. <hi>It ſhall be unto you a Sabbath of</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:40825:227"/> 
               <hi>reſt, and ye ſhall afflict your ſouls in the ninth day of the moneth at even: from even unto even ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath.)</hi> What ſhall we think the Lord expects upon this day which is mo-Pſalm 92. 1, 2. <hi>It is good to ſing of his loving kindneſs in the morning: and of his faithfulneſs every night.</hi> Jer. 17. 22. <hi>You ſhall do no work, but ſanctifie my Sabbath.</hi> Now that this may the better ſtick, conſider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, God hath given you ſix whole dayes that you may <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 9. Chap. 23. 12.</note> provide for your ſelves and families: and therefore do not deny him one day in ſeven. What an unrighteous thing is it, to buy by one meaſure which is greater, and ſell by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is leſſer. Do not rob God of his time, who hath been ſo noble, as to give you ſix in ſeven. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, God reſted all the ſeventh day: he had finiſhed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the creation in ſix dayes. God did not reſt on one part of <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> the ſeventh day, and work on the other part of the ſeventh day; but he reſted all the ſeventh day. And doubtleſs it is your wiſdom, duty and glory, to write after the coppy that God has laid before you. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Sabbath is not to be an artificial day, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a natural day; <hi>viz.</hi> twenty four hours together: as you may ſee in Lev. 23. 32. <hi>From even unto even, ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath.</hi> The dayes then were ſo reckoned. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You would not take it well at your ſervants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hands, if they ſhould only work three or four hours in a day, and either trifle away the reſt of the time, or elſe ſpend it in doing their own work when they ſhould be a doing of yours, and do you think, that the great God will take it well at your hands, that when you have ſpent three or four hours in the duties of his day, that then you ſhould either trifle away or fool away, or play away, or ſleep away, or ſin away, the remaining part of his day? But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This hath been the judgement of moſt judicious Divines in all ages. In the Counſel of <hi>Mexicon</hi> there was an Aſſembly of Miniſters out of all Nations in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and they ordained a Canon concerning the Lords Day. The Canon runs thus, <hi>We ordain that people keep the whole Lords Day holy, and that they ſet themſelves the whole day to pray to</hi>

Such who feed till they unfit themſelves for ſervice, are Belly-Gods. <hi>Paul</hi> wept over ſuch in his day, and ſo ſhould we in ours.

A full belly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtudies well, nor never prayes well, nor never hears well, nor never reads well, nor never repeats well, nor never doth any thing well either on the Lords day, or any other day. What a ſhame is it to ſee a Chriſtian a ſlave to his palate on any day; but eſpecially on the Lords day. I may uſe the creatures ſo as to ſupport and chear nature; but not ſo as to clog it, and weaken it, and debaſe it. I may uſe the creatures as my ſervants, but I muſt never ſuffer them to be my Lord. <hi>Daniel</hi> was very temperate in his diet.

            <p>O Sirs, the tongue is the nimble Interpreter of the heart. If there be piety or iniquity at the bottom of your hearts, <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 43, 44.</note> your tongues will diſcover it. The ſtream riſeth not above the fountain. We know not what mettal the Bell is made of by the Clapper. What is in the Well will be in the Bucket: What is in the Ware-houſe will be in the ſhop. So what is in the heart, will be in the mouth; if there be any thing of God, of Chriſt, of grace, of heaven, of hell, of ſin, of the world, of ſelf in the bottom of your ſouls, your tongues will diſcover it. Man (ſaith one) is like a Bell, and his tongue <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> like the Clapper. So long as this ſtandeth ſtill, he may be thought to be without any flaw, craze or crack in him; but let it once ſtir, and then he diſcovers himſelf preſently. No man can ſo change himſelf, but his heart may ſometimes be ſeen at his tongues end. Men watch Interpreters. Oh that on the Lords day eſpecially, you would make more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of watching your tongues: if the tongue be not watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be ſins Solicitor General; it will be a Bawd to all luſts: it will plead for ſin, and defend ſin, and leſſen ſin, and provoke to ſin, and ſhew the pleaſure of the heart in ſin. There are but five Virtues of the tongue reckoned up by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; but there are twenty ſeveral ſins of the tongue reckoned up by <hi>Peraldus.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> have a Proverb,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40825:230"/> 
               <hi>Take heed thy tongue cut not thy throat.</hi> Many a mans tongue <note place="margin">James 3. 3. 11. The Holy Ghoſt ſheweth the miſchief of the tongue, by the ſeveral characters by which he brands it. He calls it the flattering tongue, the double tongue, the deceitful tongue, the the lying tongue, the perverſe tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pſalm 52. 2. Prov. 18. 21. Eccleſ. 10. 12. Pſalm 19. 4. Pſalm 73. 9. Mat. 28. 13, 15.</note> has cut his throat; that is, it hath been his ruine. Our Chronicles make mention of one <hi>Burdet</hi> a Merchant, who living at the Sign of the Crown in <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi> (in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, in the year 1483.) jeſtingly ſaid to his Son, that he would leave him heir of the Crown, meaning the Sign of the Crown where he lived: for which he was apprehended, and within four hours hanged, drawn and quartered. The tongue is often like a ſharp Razor, that inſtead of ſhaving the hair, cuts the throat. If a man do not look well about him, he may every day be in danger of dying by his tongue. <hi>Life and death</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are in the power of the tongue.</hi> Gaping mouth'd men, are noted for fools by <hi>Lucian:</hi> and a better and a wiſer man than <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hath told us, That <hi>the lips of a fool will ſwallow up himſelf.</hi> Ah how good had it been for many that they had been born dumb. The tongue can eaſily travel all the world over, and wound mens names and credits in this Countrey: and that in this City, and that in this Town, and that in this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that it can in a trice run from one place to another: here it bites, and there it tears: in this place it leaves a blot, and in that it gives a wound: and therefore you have cauſe to watch your tongues on every day, but eſpecially on the Lords day. There are many whoſe tongues do more miſchief, and travel further on the Sabbath day, than they do on all the other dayes of the week. You ought to keep a ſtrict Guard upon your tongues every day, but on the Lords day you ſhould double your Guard. Satan without you, and that ſtrong party that he hath within you, will do all they can, ſo to oyle your tongues on that day, as to make you miſcarry more wayes than one, if you do not carefully look about you. Are there none on that day, that do watch your <note place="margin">Jer. 20. 10. It is better for a man to watch and ſtop his own mouth by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than to have it ſtopt by others reproofs.</note> words to deride you and jear you? Yes. Are there none on that day that do watch your words, either to enſnare you or trapan you? Yes. Are there none on that day, that do watch your words, that they may find matter if poſſible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reprove you, or to reproach you? Yes. Are there none on that day, that do watch your words, that do hang
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40825:230"/> upon your lips, expecting to be inſtructed, edified, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, comforted and ſtrengthned by you? Yes. Well then, if this be your caſe, how highly it doth concern you on this day, to watch your words, I ſhall leave you to judge. O Sirs, all your words, whether good or bad, are all noted and obſerved by God, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures <note place="margin">Pſalm 139. 4. Iſa 59. 3. Jer. 33. 24. Chap. 44. 25. Mal. 3. 16, 17. Job 42. 7. Matth. 12. 37.</note> in the Margent together. If a perſon were by us, that ſhould book all our words from Sabbath day morning to Sabbath day night, and the like on other dayes, would we not be very careful what we ſpoke. Why God is by and hears all. <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorus</hi> a Heathen uſed to ſay, that all men ought to be very careful of their actions and words; becauſe God was every where, and beheld all that was done and ſaid. And <hi>Zeno</hi> a wiſe Heathen affirmeth, that God ſeeth, and taketh notice of our very thoughts; how much more then of our words. O Sirs, how many men and women are there, that are choice of what they eat, that are not choice of what they ſpeak: that are curious about the food which goes into their mouths, leſt it ſhould hurt or poyſon them, who are no wayes curious about the words that go out of their mouths, leſt they ſhould hurt or poyſon others?</p>

               </gap> all the members in the body, there is none ſo ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Satan as the tongue. And therefore Satan ſpares <hi>Jobs</hi> tongue; his grand deſign being not to make <hi>Job</hi> a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, but a blaſphemer: <hi>Job</hi> was bliſtered all over by Satan, only his tongue was not bliſtered. Satan thought by that member, to work <hi>Job</hi> to fight againſt God, and the peace of his own ſoul. It is queried in the Schools, what was the firſt ſin of the firſt Angel that fell (for they aſſert that one fell firſt, then the reſt) Now there are very many opinions about it. Some ſay, it was envy, others diſcontent; and ſome ſay, it was their refuſing to undertake the charge that was given to them to Miniſter unto man. Others think it was a ſpiritual luxury; others ingratitude. The moſt and beſt ſay pride, but wherein that pride conſiſted, is not eaſily determined, nor by them unanimouſly reſolved; and by ſome it is as confidently obſerved, that it was a ſin of the tongue.

Give me leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o offer to your ſerious conſideration theſe four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Where the Lord hath commanded the whole man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to reſt from ſervile works; there he commands the hand to reſt from working, the foot from walking, and the tongue from talking. But in the fourth Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no manner of work,</hi> the Lord hath commanded the whole <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 10.</note> man to reſt from ſervile works. And therefore the tongue from talking of this or that worldly buſineſs. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe things which as lets hinder the duties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Lords day are forbidden. But worldly words as lets, hinder the duties of the Lords day: therefore world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words are forbidden. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Where bodily works are forbidden, there thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> things are forbidden which hinder the ſanctifying of the Sabbath as much or more, than bodily works do: but bodily works are forbidden in the fourth Commandment: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worldly words which hinder more the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, than bodily works do, are forbidden in the ſame Commandment. That worldly words do hinder the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the Sabbath, as much or more than bodily works, is evident by this (among other arguments that might be produced) that a man may work alone, but he cannot talk alone. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Commandment which tyes the outward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> man from the deed done, that Commandment ties the tongue from talking of the ſame. But the fourth Commandment ties the outward man from worldly works, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Command ties the tongue from worldly words. Certainly all thoſe perſons that make the Lords day, a reckoning-day with workmen as ſome do, or a directing-day what ſhall be done the next week, as others do; or a day of idle talk about this worldly buſineſs or that, or about this perſon or that, or about this faſhion or that, or
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40825:231"/> about this mans matters or that, or about this pleaſure or that, or about this profit or that, or about this mans calling or that, or about this Goſſips Tale or that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All ſuch perſons are prophaners and no ſanctifiers of the Lords Day.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer upon this particular, to confute and recover thoſe Chriſtians who give their tongues too great a liberty on the Lords Day.</p>
            <p>Now in theſe fourteen particulars I have ſhewed you how the Sabbath is to be ſanctified. O Sirs, as you deſire to ſee <hi>London</hi> rebuilt, as you deſire to ſee <hi>London</hi> in as great (or greater) proſperity and glory, as ſhe hath been in: as you deſire to ſee her once more the Bulwark of the Nation: As <note place="margin">Pſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As you deſire that ſhe may be an eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency <note place="margin">Zech. 2. 5.</note> a joy of many Generations. As you deſire the Lord to be for ever a wall of fire about her, and a glory in the midſt of her: M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke conſcience of ſanctifying the Sabbath in a right manner: Make it your great buſineſs and work to ſanctifie the Sabbath according to thoſe fourteen Rules which I have now laid down.</p>
            <p>I know there is a deſperate oppoſition and contrariety in the hearts of carnal men, to the ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had firſt received a Commandment <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 25. 31.</note> concerning the obſervation of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dding abroad to ſeek Manna on the Sabbath day, contrary to an expreſs prohibition: yea, when it was death <note place="margin">Chap. 31: 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> to gather ſticks on that day: yet in contempt of Heaven it ſelf, one ventures upon the breach of the Law. How ſadly and frequently the Prophets have lamented and complained of the breach of the Sabbath, I have in this Treatiſe already diſcovered; and therefore need ſay no more of it in this place. The horrid prophanation of this day in <hi>France, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany, Sweden,</hi> and in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and among all Proteſtants every where elſe, is and muſt be for a ſore lamentation. The Sabbath in all Ages hath been more or leſs crucified between prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40825:232"/> and ſuperſtition, as Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath was crucified between two Thieves. When the obſervation of the Sabbath came to be more ſacred and ſolemn in publick performances (which was about <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) preſently after Satan ſtirred up ſome Hypocrites who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>un into ſuch an extream of ſuperſtition, that they held that they might not ſtir out of their places, nor kill a flea, and a thouſand ſuch like fooleries. Yea, ſome dangerous foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they laboured to diſtill into the people; as that they might not draw a Sword to defend themſelves in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Invaſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a cloſe, remember this, that there are no Chriſtians in all the world, comparable to thoſe (for the power of godlineſs and heighths of grace, holineſs and communion with God) who are moſt ſtrict, ſerious, ſtudious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious in ſanctifying of the Lords day. Such as are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, remiſs, light, ſlight, formal and carnal upon the Sabbath day, they will be as bad, if not worſe, on every other day in the Week. The true reaſon why the power of godlineſs is fallen to ſo low an ebb both in this, and in other Countreys alſo, is becauſe the Sabbath is no more ſtrictly and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly obſerved in this Land, and in thoſe other Countreys where the name of the Lord is made known. The Jews were never ſerious in the obſervation of their Sabbaths, till they ſmarted ſeventy years in <hi>Babylon</hi> for their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of it. And who can look upon the aſhes of <hi>London,</hi> and not ſee how dearly the Citizens have paid for their prophaning of the Lords day. And Oh that all theſe ſhort hints might be ſo bleſt from Heaven, as to work us all to a more ſtrict ſerious and conſcientious ſanctifying of the Lords day, according to thoſe Directions or Rules, that I have in this Treatiſe laid before you.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with thoſe Duties that are incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon thoſe who have been burnt up by that late dreadful fire that hath turned <hi>London</hi> into a ruinous heap.</p>

            <p> I come now to thoſe Duties that are incumbent upon thoſe whoſe habitations are yet ſtanding as monuments of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, Power and Grace.

Pſalm 78. 60</note> at large: If thoſe ſins that have brought the fiery judgement upon your neighbours, are to be found among you, you have cauſe to fear the fiery Rod, or elſe ſome other judgement that ſhall be equivalent to it. If you ſin with others, you ſhall ſuffer with others; except there be found repentance on your ſide, and pardoning grace on Gods. The Lord hath puniſhed your neighbours with that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of judgements, the fire; and he expects that you ſhould take notice thereof, and be inſtructed thereby, to take heed of thoſe ſins that they have been judged for, elſe the ſame, or worſer judgements will certainly befall you.

Many have drunk deep of this cup of wrath who are a people of his choiceſt love: and therefore do not judge all them to be greater ſinners than your ſelves, that

Ponder ſeriouſly and frequently upon theſe Scriptures, Iſa. 51. 17. <hi>Awake, awake, ſtand up O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which haſt drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury, thou haſt drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.</hi> Verſe 22. <hi>Thus ſaith thy Lord, the Lord, and thy God, that pleadeth the cauſe of his people: behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling; even the dregs of the cup of my fury, thou ſhalt no more drink it again.</hi> Verſe 23. <hi>But I will put it into the hands of them that afflict thee: which have ſaid to thy ſoul, bow down, that we may go over: and thou haſt laid thy body as the ground, and as the ſtreet to them that went over.</hi> Jer. 25. 15. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>unto me, take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cauſe all the Nations, to</hi>

               <note place="margin">The particular Kings and Kingdoms that muſt drink of this cup are ſet down from <hi>verſe</hi> 19. to <hi>verſe</hi> 28. See Lam. 4. 21. Ezek. 23. 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>them, thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, ye ſhall certainly drink.</hi> ver. 29. <hi>For lo, I begin to bring evil, on the City which is called by my name, and ſhould ye be utterly unpuniſhed? ye ſhall not be unpuniſhed: I will call for a ſword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hath drunk of the cup, if God be God, the Nations round ſhall certainly drink of it. God hath begun with <hi>London:</hi> poor <hi>London</hi> hath drunk deeply of the cup of Gods fury: and therefore let the Nations round repent, or prepare to drink of <hi>Londons</hi> cup. Moſt of thoſe ſins that bring the fiery Rod (if not all) are to be found in all the great Cities of the world. And therefore let all the great Cities in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Holland, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> take warning by <hi>Londons</hi> deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prepare to meet the Lord in the way of his fury: let them ceaſe from doing evil, and learn to do well: let them repent in duſt and aſhes, leſt they are laid in duſt and aſhes. Let them break off their ſins, leſt God throws down their walls and habitations by furious and devouring flames. Let all thoſe whoſe habitations are ſtill ſtanding, remember that the ſame ſins, the ſame wrath, and the ſame malicious hands that has laid ſo many thouſand habitations deſolate, can lay theirs alſo deſolate, except they reform and turn to the Moſt High.</p>

'Tis brave when we are in the Mount, to bear the conditions of others upon our hearts, as well as our own, eſpecially theirs, whom the hand of the Lord hath ſeverely reacht.

I ſhall leave you to your choice, whether you will give credit to this relation, or look upon it as a Rabinical invention.
